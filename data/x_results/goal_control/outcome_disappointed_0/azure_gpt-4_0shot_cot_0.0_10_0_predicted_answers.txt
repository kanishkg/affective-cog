The story tells us that Amy has applied to both Stanford, which she hopes to get into, and Harvard, which she applied to only to appease her parents but does not want to attend. The image is supposed to reflect the expression of the person in the story. Since we are to ignore the physical appearance and focus on the expression, we can see that the person is not showing a clear emotion due to the blurred face. However, we can infer from the story that if Amy got into Stanford, she would be happy, and if she got into Harvard, she would be less than thrilled. Since we cannot determine the exact emotion from the image, we have to make an educated guess based on the story context. Given that Amy does not want to attend Harvard, it is likely that the expression would not be one of pure happiness if she were admitted there.

A: a. Harvard.

The story tells us that Johnny's goal is to receive offers from university teams, not Minor League teams. He invites coaches from both types of teams to watch him play. The expression in the image, despite the blurred face, appears to be one of disappointment or sadness, which suggests that the outcome was not what Johnny had hoped for. Since his goal was to get offers from university teams, the disappointed expression likely indicates that he did not achieve this goal and instead received offers from the Minor League teams, which was not his preference.

A: a. Minor league baseball teams.

- Emma fears losing these connections if she moves to the big city.
- The image is supposed to reflect Emma's feelings about her situation. However, we cannot see her facial expression because it is blurred.
- Without the facial expression, we cannot determine Emma's current emotional state or the outcome of her job search based on the image.

A: a. Emma finds a job in her hometown.

- The story tells us that Ben wants to work with local clients and not high-profile clients due to the pressure.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate a strong emotion either way.
- Since the expression is neutral, it does not strongly suggest that Ben has attracted either local clients or high-profile clients based on his fears or desires.
- However, given that Ben's preference is for local clients and he has taken action by creating an online portfolio, it's possible that his efforts have been successful in attracting the type of clients he prefers.

A: b. Local clients.

- Ivan is less concerned about making friends at the gym, which suggests that friendships are not his priority.
- The image shows a person with a confident posture, standing tall with shoulders back, which is often associated with confidence and a sense of accomplishment.

A: a. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

- Gary wants to join the school band because he believes it will help him develop his skills as a musician.
- He does not want to join the school choir because he is not as confident in his singing abilities.
- The image shows a person with an expression that we need to interpret to understand how Gary feels about the group he got accepted into.
- Since we are to ignore the blurred face and focus on the expression, we can see that the person's body language and posture do not indicate happiness or excitement, which one would expect if Gary had been accepted into his preferred choice, the school band.
- Therefore, it is likely that Gary got accepted into the school choir, which he was not confident about and did not want to join.

A: a. School choir.

- The expression in the image, although we are not considering the blurred face, seems to be one of satisfaction and contentment, which could indicate that Max found what he was looking for.
- Given these points, it is more likely that Max ended up with a stylish, expensive outfit from a boutique that aligns with his desire for a unique and statement-making outfit.

The story tells us that Ethan is passionate about acting and really wants the leading role in the play. He believes that getting the leading role will showcase his talent and lead to more opportunities, whereas a supporting role may limit his potential. The image shows a person with an expression that we cannot see due to the blurred face. However, we can infer from the context of the story and the fact that we are asked to guess based on the expression, that the expression would reflect the outcome of the audition. Since we cannot see the expression, we must make an educated guess based on the information provided in the story.

A: b. Ethan got a supporting role.

A: a. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
