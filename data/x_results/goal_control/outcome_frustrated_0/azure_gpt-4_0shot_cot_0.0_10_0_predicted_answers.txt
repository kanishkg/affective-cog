- Amy applied to both Stanford, which she hopes to attend, and Harvard, which she applied to only to appease her parents but does not want to attend.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, seems to be one of disappointment or dissatisfaction, as the person's shoulders are slumped and the overall posture suggests a lack of enthusiasm or happiness.
- Since Amy dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend, if she were accepted there instead of her preferred choice, Stanford, she would likely exhibit an expression of disappointment.
- Therefore, based on the expression suggested by the posture, it is more likely that Amy got into Harvard, which aligns with her feelings of disappointment.

A: a. Harvard.
