Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford.
- She hopes to be admitted to Harvard but does not want to attend Stanford.
- The expression in the image is meant to reflect Amy's feelings after submitting her applications.
- Since we are to ignore the blurred face and focus on the expression, we must infer Amy's feelings based on the context provided in the story.
- If Amy got into Harvard, she would likely be happy or excited, which would be reflected in a positive expression.
- If Amy got into Stanford, which she does not want to attend, her expression would likely be less positive, perhaps showing disappointment or dissatisfaction.
- The image shows an expression that is not clearly positive or negative due to the blurred face, but we are to give our best guess based on the story context.
- Given that Amy dislikes Stanford and does not want to attend, it is reasonable to infer that if she got into Stanford, her expression would align with a less positive emotion.

A:a. Stanford.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Johnny's goal is to receive offers from Minor League Baseball teams, not universities.
- The expression in the image is one of disappointment or sadness.
- If Johnny had received offers from Minor League teams, his expression would likely be happy or excited, aligning with his goals.
- Since the expression is not positive, it suggests that the outcome is not what Johnny desired.
- Therefore, it is more likely that Johnny received offers from universities, which is not what he wanted.

A: a. Universities.

- The story tells us that Emma wants to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth.
- Emma fears stagnation if she stays in her hometown.
- The image shows a person with an expression that we need to interpret to understand Emma's situation.
- Since we cannot see the face, we must rely on the context provided by the story.

A: b. Emma finds a job in the big city.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not clearly indicate happiness or disappointment. Since the story does not provide specific information about the outcome of Ben's efforts to attract clients, we cannot determine from the expression alone whether Ben attracted high-profile clients or local clients. The neutral expression could suggest that the outcome was neither exceptionally good nor bad, or it could simply be unrelated to the outcome of Ben's efforts. Without more information, we can only make a guess.

A: b. Local clients.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- The story tells us that Ivan's primary goal is to make friends at the gym, and he believes attending group fitness classes will help him meet like-minded people.
- Ivan is less concerned about improving his physical fitness, which suggests that any positive outcome related to fitness would be a secondary benefit rather than his main focus.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not clearly indicate whether Ivan has achieved his goal of making friends or improved his physical fitness.
- Since we cannot determine the person's feelings from the neutral expression, we must rely on the information provided in the story.
- Based on the story, Ivan's main goal is to make friends, and attending the group fitness class is his strategy to achieve that goal.

A:b. Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Gary wants to join the school choir because it aligns with his passion for improving his vocal skills.
- He does not want to join the school band as he believes it won't give him enough individual practice time.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly disappointed expression, which suggests that the outcome is not what the person desired.
- Since Gary's preference is the school choir, the expression implies that he did not get what he wanted.
- Therefore, it is likely that Gary got accepted into the school band, which is not his preference.

A: a. School band.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- The story mentions that Max wants to find an outfit that is affordable, even if it's not as unique.
- Max does not want to spend too much money.
- The expression in the image, although we are not considering the physical appearance, seems to be neutral or content, which could suggest that Max found something that met his criteria.
- Given these points, it is more likely that Max ended up with an affordable outfit rather than a stylish, expensive one.

A:a. An affordable outfit from a department store.

The story tells us that Ethan is passionate about acting and wants a supporting role to learn from more experienced actors. He fears the pressure of a leading role. The image shows an expression that we need to interpret without considering the blurred face. The expression seems to be one of surprise or shock, which could indicate an unexpected outcome. Since Ethan did not want the leading role, his expression might suggest that he got it despite his preference for a supporting role.

A: b. Ethan got the leading role.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Eliza's primary goal is to meet and connect with the actors, which is more important to her than enjoying the play itself.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, seems to be neutral or possibly slightly positive, suggesting that the person is not overly excited or disappointed.
- If Eliza had met the actors and had engaging conversations, which was her main goal, her expression would likely be more visibly happy or excited.
- Since her expression is not showing clear excitement, it suggests that she may not have achieved her primary goal of meeting the actors.
- However, since the expression is not one of clear disappointment either, it could indicate that she found some enjoyment in the play itself, even though it was not her main objective.

A:b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

- Since we cannot determine the exact outcome based on the expression, we must rely on the information provided in the story.
- The story suggests that Rachel is less concerned about gaining a deeper understanding of the artist's work and more interested in making connections with people who share her interest in art.

A: b. Rachel became friends with fellow art enthusiasts during the guided tour.
