Thought: Let's think step by step:
The story tells us that Amy hoped to be admitted to Stanford, which indicates she had a desire for a specific outcome. However, the fact that she was rejected from Stanford and accepted to Harvard, a school she did not want to attend, suggests that the outcome was not within her control. The expression in the image, although we are not considering the blurred face, seems to be one of disappointment or sadness, which would align with someone who has experienced an outcome they did not desire and could not control.

A: a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
