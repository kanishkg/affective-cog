Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Amy applied to both Stanford and Harvard, indicating she took the necessary actions to potentially control the outcome by submitting applications.
- However, the outcome was not what she desired; she was rejected from her preferred choice, Stanford, and accepted to Harvard, which she did not want to attend.
- The expression in the image shows disappointment or dissatisfaction, which could suggest that Amy feels outcomes were beyond her control, as her efforts did not lead to her preferred result.
- The question is about Amy's belief in her ability to control the admissions outcome, not the actual control itself. Her actions show hope or intention to influence the outcome, but the result and her expression suggest a recognition that the outcome was ultimately not in her control.

A: a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
