Emma applies to various jobs in both locations, suggesting she is trying to keep her options open and is unsure which path will lead to the best outcome.
The fact that Emma finds a promising job in the big city but not in her hometown, despite her preference to stay local, implies that she recognizes her future is uncertain and not entirely within her control based on location alone.

The worried, uncertain expression in the image aligns with Emma's situation of wanting to stay in her hometown for relationships, but facing limited job prospects there compared to the big city. Her actions of applying widely and the outcome of finding a better job in the city suggest Emma recognizes her future is not entirely within her control based just on location preference.

- Ben wanted to work with local clients because he valued supporting small businesses and enjoyed building personal relationships.
- He did not want to work with high-profile clients because he feared he wouldn't be able to handle the pressure.
- Ben created an online portfolio and shared it on social media to attract clients.
- However, he ended up attracting high-profile clients requiring work for multinational corporations, not the local clients he was targeting.

The fact that Ben took specific actions (creating a portfolio, sharing on social media) to try to attract a certain type of client (local small businesses) suggests he believed he could control the types of clients he acquired through his own efforts. However, the actual clients he attracted were different from what he intended, implying that factors beyond his control also played a role in determining his client base.

The person's frowning, disappointed expression in the image matches the idea that Ben did not get the result he wanted or expected from his efforts to control his client acquisition.

A:b. Ben believed he could control the types of clients he acquires by promoting his work and networking effectively.

1. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness by attending group fitness classes at the gym.
2. Making friends at the gym was a secondary concern for Ivan.
3. The fact that Ivan chose to attend group fitness classes to improve his fitness suggests he believed he had control over achieving this goal through his actions.

The expression in the image appears frustrated or disappointed, which aligns with Ivan being unable to improve his fitness despite attending classes, counter to his belief that he could control this outcome.

A:b. Ivan believed that by attending the group fitness class regularly, he could control his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he makes.

1. Gary auditioned for both the school band and choir, indicating he was uncertain about which one he would get into.
2. Gary wanted to join the band more than the choir, as he was more confident in his instrumental skills than his singing.
3. Despite his preference, Gary was accepted into the choir but not the band.
4. The expression in the image shows disappointment or frustration, likely mirroring how Gary felt about the audition results.

Given these points, it seems Gary believed the outcome of the auditions was uncertain and not entirely within his control. If he felt he could fully control the results, he likely would have only auditioned for the band. The fact that he was accepted into his less preferred option (the choir) and not the band further suggests the outcome was not what he expected or hoped for.

A:a. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into.

A:b. Max believed he could control the outcome by searching for the perfect outfit and trying on different options. Max's actions of actively browsing stores, trying on outfits, and being selective rather than settling indicate he thought he could control finding the perfect outfit through his own efforts, not just luck.
