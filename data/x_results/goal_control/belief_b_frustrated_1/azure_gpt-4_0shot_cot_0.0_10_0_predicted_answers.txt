The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly content expression, but we are to ignore the physical appearance and focus solely on the expression. The story tells us that Amy got into Stanford and was rejected from Harvard. If Amy had wanted to go to Harvard more than Stanford, her expression would likely be one of disappointment or sadness due to the rejection. However, since the expression is neutral or content, it suggests that the outcome is acceptable or even pleasing to her. Therefore, it is more likely that Amy wanted to go to Stanford, which she got into, and applied to Harvard to appease her parents, without a strong personal desire to attend Harvard.

A: a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.
