- Amy has applied to both Harvard and Stanford.
- She wants to go to Harvard and does not want to attend Stanford.
- The expression in the image is meant to reflect how Amy feels about her college admissions outcome.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly slightly disappointed expression, which does not clearly indicate joy or excitement.
- Since Amy dislikes Stanford and would not be happy to attend, and she would be happy to get into Harvard, the expression suggests that she did not get into her preferred choice, Harvard.
- Therefore, the best guess based on the expression is that Amy got into Stanford, which she did not want to attend.

A:b. Stanford.

The image shows a person with a disappointed or sad expression. Since Johnny's goal is to receive offers from Minor League Baseball teams and not universities, his expression would likely be one of disappointment if he received offers from universities instead of his desired Minor League teams.

The story tells us that Emma wants to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth. She fears stagnation if she stays in her hometown. The image shows an expression, which we are to use to infer Emma's decision. Since we are to ignore the physical appearance and focus on the expression, we can see that the person in the image is wearing a hoodie, which is often associated with casual or informal settings, not necessarily indicative of a professional environment one might find in a big city. However, the expression itself cannot be seen due to the blurred face, so we cannot use it to determine Emma's feelings or decisions. Therefore, we must rely solely on the information provided in the story, which suggests that Emma's desire is to move to the big city.

A:b. Emma finds a job in the big city.

- Ben wants to work with high-profile clients and not local clients.
- The expression in the image is meant to represent Ben's feelings after sharing his portfolio.
- The expression, based on the posture and the visible part of the body, seems to be one of disappointment or dissatisfaction.
- If Ben had attracted high-profile clients, his expression would likely be more positive.

- Gary wants to join the school choir more than the school band.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly content expression, not one of disappointment or sadness.
- If Gary had been accepted into the school choir, which he preferred, his expression would likely be more visibly happy or excited.
- Since the expression is not clearly happy, it suggests that he did not get into his preferred choice, the school choir.
- Therefore, it is more likely that he got accepted into the school band, which he was less enthusiastic about.

A: b. School band.

The story tells us that Ethan is passionate about acting and is auditioning for a role in a play. He wants a supporting role and fears the pressure of a leading role. The image shows an expression, which we must use to infer the outcome of his audition. Since we are instructed to ignore the physical appearance and focus on the expression, we can see that the person in the image appears to be neutral or possibly slightly displeased, which could indicate that Ethan did not get what he wanted. If Ethan wanted a supporting role and feared the leading role, this expression might suggest that he did not get the supporting role he desired.

A: b. Ethan got the leading role.

- The story tells us that Eliza's primary goal is to meet and connect with the actors, and she is less concerned about whether she enjoys the play itself.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate clear happiness or disappointment.
- Since Eliza's main goal is to meet the actors, and the expression does not show excitement or joy, it suggests that she did not achieve her primary goal.
- Therefore, the expression aligns more with the scenario where she did not meet the actors, as that would likely be more disappointing to her than not enjoying the play.

A: a. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
- The story tells us that Rachel's primary goal for attending the museum was to connect with fellow art enthusiasts, not necessarily to learn more about her favorite artist's work.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not provide any specific information about Rachel's experiences or outcomes from her museum visit.
- Since the story emphasizes Rachel's goal of meeting like-minded people and the image does not contradict this, we can infer that Rachel likely achieved her goal of making new friendships rather than gaining a deeper understanding of the artist's work.

A: a. Rachel became friends with fellow art enthusiasts during the guided tour.
