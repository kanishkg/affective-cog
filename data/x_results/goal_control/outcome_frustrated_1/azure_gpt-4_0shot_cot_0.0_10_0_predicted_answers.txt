Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford.
- Amy wants to go to Harvard and does not want to attend Stanford.
- The expression in the image, excluding the blurred face, appears to be one of disappointment or dissatisfaction.
- If Amy had been admitted to Harvard, her preferred choice, she would likely be happy or excited.
- Since the expression is not one of happiness, it suggests that the outcome is not what Amy desired.
- Therefore, it is more likely that Amy got into Stanford, the college she did not want to attend, which would explain the disappointed expression.

A: a. Stanford.

The story tells us that Johnny's goal is to receive offers from Minor League Baseball teams, not university teams. He invited coaches from both types of teams to watch him play. The expression in the image, despite the blurred face, shows a person with a slightly downturned mouth and a generally somber or disappointed look. This expression suggests that the outcome was not what the person was hoping for. Since Johnny's goal was to get offers from Minor League teams, the disappointed expression implies that he did not achieve his goal. Therefore, it is more likely that he received offers from universities instead of Minor League teams.

A:b. Universities.

- The story tells us that Emma wants to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth.
- Emma fears stagnation if she stays in her hometown.
- The image is supposed to reflect Emma's feelings, but we are to ignore the blurred face and focus on the expression.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly content expression, but we cannot determine Emma's exact feelings or the outcome of her job search based solely on this expression.
- Since we cannot use the image to make a definitive conclusion about Emma's decision, we must rely on the information provided in the story.
- Based on the story, Emma's desire is to move to the big city, not to stay in her hometown.

A: a. Emma finds a job in the big city.

- The expression in the image is meant to represent Ben's feelings after sharing his portfolio.
- The expression, although blurred, seems to be neutral or possibly not overly excited or disappointed.
- Since the story does not provide a definitive outcome of Ben's efforts, we can only infer from the expression.
- A neutral or non-excited expression might suggest that the outcome was not the high-profile clients Ben was hoping for.

A: a. Local clients.

- Gary is passionate about music and wants to improve his vocal skills, which is why he wants to join the school choir.
- He auditions for both the school band and the school choir, but he prefers the choir.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not clearly indicate happiness or disappointment.
- Since the expression is neutral, it does not strongly suggest that Gary got into his preferred choice, the school choir, nor does it indicate that he got into the school band, which he was less interested in.
- However, given that Gary prepared well and was passionate about joining the choir, it's possible that he could have been accepted into the choir but is remaining composed or is still processing the news.

A:a. School choir.

- The story mentions that Max is looking for an outfit that is affordable and he doesn't want to spend too much money.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, seems to be neutral or content, which could suggest that Max found something that met his criteria.
- Since Max was looking for something affordable, it is less likely that he chose a stylish, expensive outfit from a boutique.
- Therefore, it is more probable that Max ended up with an affordable outfit from a department store.

A:b. An affordable outfit from a department store.

- Ethan is passionate about acting and wants a supporting role to learn from more experienced actors.
- He does not want the leading role due to the pressure it may entail.
- The image shows the expression of the person after the audition, which we are to use to infer the outcome.
- Since we cannot see the face, we must rely on other cues such as body language or the general mood conveyed by the image.
- The person in the image has a relaxed posture, with shoulders down and a casual stance.
- This relaxed posture could indicate contentment or acceptance, which might suggest that Ethan got the role he wanted, which is a supporting role.

A: a. Ethan got a supporting role.

- The story tells us that Eliza's primary goal is to meet and connect with the actors, and she is less concerned about whether she enjoys the play itself.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or possibly slightly disappointed expression, which does not clearly indicate a strong positive or negative emotion.
- Since Eliza's main goal is to meet the actors, and the expression does not show clear joy or excitement, it suggests that she may not have achieved her primary goal.
- Therefore, the best guess would be that Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors, as meeting them would likely have resulted in a more visibly positive expression.

A: b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.

- The story tells us that Rachel's primary goal is to connect with fellow art enthusiasts, not necessarily to learn more about her favorite artist's work.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate a particular outcome of Rachel's visit.
- Since the story emphasizes Rachel's goal of meeting like-minded people and the image does not contradict this, we can infer that Rachel likely achieved her goal of making new friendships rather than gaining a deeper understanding of the artist's work.

A: b. Rachel became friends with fellow art enthusiasts during the guided tour.
