The person in the image has a neutral expression. This could mean that they are feeling a variety of emotions, such as happiness, sadness, or anger. It is difficult to tell exactly what the person is feeling based on the image alone.
However, we can use the information in the story to help us understand what the person might be feeling.

Eliza believes that by attending the play and staying afterwards, she can control her enjoyment of the play and the likelihood of meeting the actors. Eliza's primary goal is to meet and connect with the actors in the play, as she aspires to be an actor herself. She is less concerned about whether she enjoys the play itself.

A: b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
