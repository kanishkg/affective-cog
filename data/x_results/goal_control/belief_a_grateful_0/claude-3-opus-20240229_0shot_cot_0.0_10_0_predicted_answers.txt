- Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness by attending group fitness classes at the gym.
- Making friends at the gym was less of a priority for Ivan.

While making friends was less of a priority, attending the class still gave him an avenue to potentially make friends, even if it was less certain. So Ivan likely believed he had more control over his fitness than friend-making, but still some influence over both by choosing to attend the class.
