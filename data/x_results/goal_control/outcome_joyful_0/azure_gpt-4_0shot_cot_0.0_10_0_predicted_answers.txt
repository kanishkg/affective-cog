The story tells us that Amy has a preference for Stanford and does not want to attend Harvard. The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not clearly indicate happiness or disappointment. Since we cannot deduce the exact emotion from the neutral expression, we cannot be certain which college Amy got into based on the image alone. However, since Amy dislikes Harvard and the expression is not overtly happy, it could suggest that she did not get into her preferred choice, Stanford. 

A: b. Harvard
