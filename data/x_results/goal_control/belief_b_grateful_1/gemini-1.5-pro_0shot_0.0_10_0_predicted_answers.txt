## Analyzing Ivan's Goals and Emotions:

**A: b. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.**

**Explanation:**

1. **Expression Analysis:** The image shows a content and slightly relieved expression. This suggests achieving one goal while not necessarily achieving the other. 
2. **Goal Priority:** Given the two potential primary goals, achieving the fitness goal aligns better with the expression. If making friends was the primary goal, the inability to improve fitness wouldn't likely result in a content expression. 
3. **Secondary Goal Achievement:** Making friends despite not improving fitness aligns with the positive aspect of the expression. This reinforces the idea that fitness improvement was the primary goal.

Therefore, based on the information and expression analysis, option b is the most likely scenario for Ivan's goals and emotional state.
