1. The image shows a person with a content, slightly smiling expression with closed eyes, suggesting a sense of satisfaction or relief.

2. The story doesn't explicitly state Amy's preferences between Harvard and Stanford.

3. Amy believed she couldn't control the outcome of her admissions, implying she was open to various possibilities.

4. Amy got into Harvard and was rejected from Stanford.

5. Given her facial expression in the image (content and relieved), it seems Amy is happy with the outcome.

6. This happiness aligns more with getting into the school she wanted rather than being rejected from her preferred choice.

7. Option a suggests Amy preferred Stanford and disliked Harvard, which doesn't match her apparent contentment.

8. Option b suggests Amy wanted to go to Harvard and be closer to home, which better aligns with her positive reaction to the outcome.

Based on this reasoning and the given expression, the most likely answer is:

A:b. Amy wanted to go to Harvard, and did not wish to attend Stanford because she wanted to be closer to home.

1. The story mentions two goals for Ivan: improving physical fitness and making new friends.
2. The question asks about Ivan's "primary" goal, implying we need to determine which was more important to him.
3. The story states: "Ivan, a young man who recently started going to the gym, wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends."

1. The story states that Gary is passionate about music and dreams of becoming a professional musician.
2. Gary was considering joining either the school band or the school choir to gain more experience and exposure.
3. The story explicitly mentions that Gary auditioned for both the school band and the school choir.

1. The story states that Eliza is a "theater enthusiast" attending a local theater production.
2. It mentions she is "excited to experience the show and potentially meet some of the actors."
3. The order of mentioning these two aspects (experiencing the show first, then meeting actors) might indicate priority.
4. The question asks about Eliza's "primary goal," which suggests we need to identify her main objective.
5. The story doesn't mention any aspiration of Eliza to become an actor herself.
6. The image shows a person with closed eyes and a slight smile, which could indicate contentment or satisfaction, but doesn't provide specific information about Eliza's goals.

1. The story states that Rachel is an art enthusiast who visits the museum for a special exhibition featuring her favorite artist.
2. This suggests her primary interest is in the art itself, particularly work by her favorite artist.
3. The story mentions that Rachel "believes that her experience at the museum depends on factors beyond her control, such as the quality of the guided tour."
4. This implies that she was hoping to gain something from the guided tour, likely knowledge about the art.
