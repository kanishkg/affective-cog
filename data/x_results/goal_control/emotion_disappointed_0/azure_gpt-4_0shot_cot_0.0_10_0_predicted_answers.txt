Gary's goal was to join the school band to develop his skills as a musician, but he was not accepted into the band and instead got into the choir, which he was not confident about. This outcome is not what he desired, and it is likely to cause a negative emotion. The options provided are frustrated, disappointed, joyful, and grateful. Since Gary did not achieve his preferred outcome, joyful and grateful can be eliminated as they are positive emotions. Between frustrated and disappointed, disappointed is more fitting because it directly relates to not achieving a desired goal or outcome. Frustration often involves an obstacle or challenge in one's path, which is not the primary issue here. Gary's primary issue is not getting what he wanted, which aligns more with disappointment.
