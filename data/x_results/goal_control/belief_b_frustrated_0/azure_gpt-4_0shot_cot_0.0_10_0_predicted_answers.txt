The story tells us that Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford, which implies she had an interest in attending either institution. The fact that she crafted a quality application shows her desire to be accepted by the colleges she applied to. The image provided shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not give us a clear indication of happiness or disappointment. Since the story does not provide specific information about Amy's preference between Harvard and Stanford, we cannot conclusively determine which college she wanted to attend more based on her expression alone. However, since she was accepted to Harvard and rejected from Stanford, it is possible that she may have had a preference for Stanford, as people often feel more disappointed about rejections from their top choice. 

A:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.
