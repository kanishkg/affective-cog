- Amy has applied to both Harvard and Stanford.
- She hopes to be admitted to Harvard and does not want to attend Stanford.
- The expression we are to consider is one of disappointment or dissatisfaction, as indicated by the downturned mouth and the overall unhappy demeanor.

- The expression in the image, ignoring the blurred face, appears to be one of disappointment or sadness.
- If Johnny had received offers from the Minor Leagues, which aligns with his goal, his expression would likely be more positive.
