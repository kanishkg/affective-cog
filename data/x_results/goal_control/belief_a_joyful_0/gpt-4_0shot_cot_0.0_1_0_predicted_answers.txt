Thought: Let's think step by step:
- The story does not provide explicit information about Amy's beliefs regarding her control over the college admissions process.
- However, the fact that Amy applied to both Stanford and Harvard suggests that she took action to influence the outcome to some extent.
- The image shows a person with a slight smile, which could indicate satisfaction or contentment.
- Since Amy got into her preferred college, Stanford, and was rejected from Harvard, which she did not want to attend, the expression could reflect her happiness with the outcome.
- The expression does not necessarily indicate whether Amy believed she could control the outcome, but rather her reaction to the outcome itself.

A:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
