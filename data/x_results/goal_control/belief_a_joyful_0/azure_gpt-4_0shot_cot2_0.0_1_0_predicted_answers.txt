Thought: Let's think step by step:
The story tells us that Amy applied to both Stanford, which she hopes to get into, and Harvard, to appease her parents, despite her dislike for it. The outcome was that she got into Stanford and was rejected from Harvard. The image shows a person with a subtle smile and a relaxed posture, suggesting contentment or satisfaction. This expression aligns with someone who received good news or a favorable outcome. Since Amy got into her preferred college and avoided the one she disliked, the expression suggests she is pleased with the outcome. However, the story does not provide any information about Amy's belief in her ability to control the admissions process. College admissions are typically seen as a competitive and uncertain process, so it's likely that Amy, like most students, did not feel she had full control over the outcome.

A:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
