Thought: Let's think step by step:
The story tells us that Amy applied to both Stanford, which she hopes to be admitted to, and Harvard, to appease her parents, despite her dislike for it. The fact that she applied to both indicates that she took action towards her goal but also suggests that she understood the competitive nature of college admissions and the uncertainty involved. The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not provide any additional information about Amy's beliefs regarding her control over the admissions process. Therefore, we can only rely on the information provided in the story.

A: b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
