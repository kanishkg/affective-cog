The story tells us that Amy wants to go to Stanford and does not want to attend Harvard. The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate clear happiness or disappointment. Since Amy dislikes Harvard, if she had been admitted there, she would likely show a negative expression. Conversely, if she had been admitted to Stanford, her desired college, she would likely show a positive expression. The neutral expression suggests that the outcome was neither her best nor worst scenario, or it's not possible to determine the outcome based on the expression alone. However, since we have to choose an option, the neutral expression might slightly lean towards the less desired outcome, which is Harvard in Amy's case.

A:b. Harvard.

The story tells us that Ethan is passionate about acting and really wants the leading role in the play. He believes that the leading role will showcase his talent and lead to more opportunities, while a supporting role may limit his potential. The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not clearly indicate happiness or disappointment. Since we cannot see the face, we must rely on the body language and posture, which seem relaxed but not particularly expressive of joy or success. Given that Ethan has high hopes for the leading role, a neutral expression might suggest that he did not get the exact outcome he desired.

A:b. Ethan got a supporting role.

The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate clear happiness or disappointment. Since Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production, and she believed the local theater had a good reputation for putting on great shows, it's likely that her neutral expression is not due to the play itself. The neutral expression could suggest that while she did not have a negative experience, she also did not have the additional positive experience of meeting the actors, which was a less important goal for her. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.

A:b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
