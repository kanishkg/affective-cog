1. Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford, indicating she was interested in attending both schools.
2. The story states Amy "gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford", but does not specify her preference between the two.
3. The expression in the image appears disappointed or upset, suggesting the outcome was not what Amy hoped for.
4. If Amy had wanted to attend Harvard over Stanford, she would likely be happy or relieved at the result, not disappointed.
5. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that Amy wanted to go to Stanford, but was rejected, leading to her disappointed expression.

1. Johnny invited coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams to watch him play.
2. However, Johnny only received offers from Minor League teams, not from any university teams.
3. The image shows a disappointed, dejected facial expression, suggesting Johnny did not get the offers he was hoping for.
4. If Johnny's primary goal was to receive Minor League offers, he likely would have been pleased with the outcome. His disappointed expression indicates the Minor League offers alone were not his desired result.

A:a. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from University teams, so he could train in college and have a chance of getting drafted to the MLB. He did not want to play in the Minor Leagues.

2. He considered joining either the school band or the school choir to gain experience and exposure.
3. Gary auditioned for both the school band and the school choir, indicating he was open to either option.
4. The question asks what Gary wanted for his musical future, not which specific group he preferred.
5. The image shows a disappointed or sad expression, suggesting Gary did not get the outcome he hoped for.

A:a. Gary wanted to join the school band because he believes it will help him develop his skills as a musician and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He did not want to join the school choir because he is not as confident in his singing abilities.
