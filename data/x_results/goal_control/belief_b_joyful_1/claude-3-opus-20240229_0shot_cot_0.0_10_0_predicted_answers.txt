1. Johnny invited coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams to watch him play.
2. However, Johnny only received offers from Minor League teams, not from any university teams.
3. The image shows a disappointed, dejected facial expression, suggesting Johnny did not get the offers he was hoping for.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Eliza is described as a "theater enthusiast", suggesting a strong interest in theater in general.
- The story states Eliza was "excited to experience the show and potentially meet some of the actors." This indicates two goals - enjoying the show itself and meeting the actors.

- In the end, Eliza did not enjoy the play but did have engaging conversations with the actors. This outcome aligns more with a primary goal of meeting the actors.

The person in the image has a somewhat neutral, slightly disappointed facial expression. This could match Eliza not enjoying the play itself as much as she had hoped.

A:b. Rachel's primary goal was to learn more about her favorite artist's work, and she believed attending the guided tour would help her achieve this. She was less concerned about making friends at the museum.
