Thought: Let's think step by step:
The story tells us that Amy hopes to be admitted to Harvard, which indicates that she desires a positive outcome but does not necessarily believe she can control it. The fact that she also applied to Stanford, despite not wanting to attend, suggests she is trying to increase her chances of college admission, which could imply a lack of certainty about controlling the outcome. The image provided shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not convey a strong sense of control or lack thereof. Since the story does not explicitly state Amy's belief in her ability to control the admissions outcome, we must infer from her actions and the context provided.

A:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
