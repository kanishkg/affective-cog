Thought: Let's think step by step:
- The story does not provide explicit information about Amy's beliefs regarding her control over the college admissions process.
- However, the fact that Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford suggests that she took action to influence the outcome to some extent.
- The image shows a person with a slight smile, which could indicate satisfaction or contentment.
- Since Amy got into Harvard, which was her preferred choice, and was rejected from Stanford, which she did not want to attend, the expression could reflect her happiness with the outcome.
- The expression does not directly answer the question about her belief in controlling the admissions outcome, but it does suggest she might be pleased with the results.

A:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.
