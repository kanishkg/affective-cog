1. Amy applied to both Stanford and Harvard for college.
2. The story doesn't specify which school Amy preferred or wanted to attend more.
3. Without knowing Amy's preference between the two schools, we can't determine if getting into Stanford but being rejected from Harvard matches what she wanted or not.
4. Neither of the provided answer options can be definitively supported based on the limited information given in the story.
5. The facial expression in the image appears disappointed or unhappy, which could suggest Amy did not get the college admissions outcome she hoped for, but this is speculative without more context.

A:b. Based on the story alone, there is not enough information provided to determine which school Amy truly wanted to attend. The answer options make assumptions about Amy's preferences that are not supported by the details given.

1. Johnny invited coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams to watch him play.
2. This suggests Johnny was interested in receiving offers from both university teams and Minor League teams.
3. However, Johnny only received offers from universities, not from any Minor League teams.

- He wants to increase his client base by creating an online portfolio and sharing it on social media
- The story states that Ben attracts local clients who require graphic design work for their small businesses
- However, it also mentions that Ben does not find high-profile clients
