Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. The story describes Ben conducting an experiment that resulted in an unexpected small explosion.
2. Ben had considered the possibility of an explosion, recognizing it as dangerous and potentially damaging to the lab and equipment.
3. The image shows a person with a somewhat concerned or worried expression.
4. The eyebrows are slightly furrowed, and the mouth is turned down slightly at the corners.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Penelope has prepared extensively for this concert, investing months of practice and composition.
2. She anticipated potential issues, considering a guitar string breaking as manageable but a sound system malfunction as dangerous.
3. Unfortunately, her worst-case scenario occurred - the sound system malfunctioned during her performance.
4. This malfunction leads to poor audio quality, making it difficult for the audience to hear her music properly.
5. Given the importance of this concert (her first live one) and the severity of the issue (affecting the entire performance), this would be extremely upsetting for Penelope.
6. Looking at the expression in the image, we see:
   - Eyebrows raised and drawn together
   - Eyes wide and concerned
   - Mouth turned down at the corners
   - Overall expression of distress and unhappiness
7. This expression aligns most closely with feeling devastated - a sense of extreme disappointment and upset.

1. The story describes Xavier serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which he had previously thought would be a dangerous mistake.

2. This is exactly the scenario Xavier was worried about, as it could potentially cause an allergic reaction or offend the guest.

3. The image shows a person with a deeply concerned and worried expression.

4. Their eyebrows are raised, eyes are wide, and mouth is slightly open, indicating a mix of shock and distress.

5. This expression aligns most closely with feeling devastated, as it shows a strong negative emotional reaction.

   - Relieved: This is opposite to what the expression conveys.
   - Resigned: The expression is too active and distressed to indicate resignation.

Given the gravity of the mistake and the expression shown, the most fitting answer is:
