Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Sarah is a solo hiker on a challenging mountain trail.
2. She was prepared for fog, but considered snowfall dangerous.
3. Upon reaching the summit, she encounters snowfall.
4. The image shows a person with a concerned and worried expression.
5. The eyebrows are slightly raised and drawn together.
6. The mouth is slightly open and turned down at the corners.
7. The overall expression conveys a sense of worry and distress.
8. Given the situation and the expression, Sarah is likely feeling more than just surprised.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Julian had expectations about the investors' reactions:
   - Questions about long-term viability would be a good sign.
   - Criticism about market fit would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch.

2. The actual outcome:
   - Investors sharply criticized the product's market fit.
   - They demanded substantial changes.

3. This outcome aligns with Julian's worst-case scenario.

4. The expression in the image shows:
   - A downturned mouth
   - Furrowed brows
   - An overall look of distress and disappointment

5. Considering Julian's expectations and the actual outcome, he would likely feel extremely disappointed and upset.

6. Looking at the options:
   a. Resigned - doesn't capture the intensity of the situation
   b. Surprised - doesn't fit as Julian anticipated this possibility
   c. Relieved - opposite of how he would feel given the circumstances
   d. Devastated - best matches the severity of the situation and the expression shown

A:d. devastated
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. The story describes Ben conducting an experiment with potential risks.
2. Ben anticipated two possible outcomes: a small explosion (which he considered safe) or toxic gas (which he considered dangerous).
3. The experiment resulted in the production of toxic gas, forcing Ben to evacuate the lab.
4. Looking at the expression in the image:
   - The person's eyebrows are slightly raised
   - Their eyes are wide open
   - Their mouth is slightly open, with corners turned down
   - Overall, the expression conveys a mix of shock and concern
5. Considering the options:
   - "Resigned" doesn't fit as it would imply acceptance, which isn't shown here
   - "Relieved" is incorrect as the situation is dangerous
   - "Devastated" seems too extreme for the expression shown
   - "Surprised" aligns best with the wide-eyed, slightly open-mouthed expression

6. The unexpected and dangerous outcome (toxic gas) would naturally lead to surprise.

A:d. surprised

1. Xavier accidentally spilled a drink on one of the influential guests.
2. He had previously thought this would be a "dangerous" situation.
3. The image shows a person with a distressed expression.
4. The face in the image displays:
   - Raised eyebrows, indicating shock or distress
   - Wide, alarmed eyes
