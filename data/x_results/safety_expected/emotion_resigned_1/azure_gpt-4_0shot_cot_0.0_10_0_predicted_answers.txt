Sarah was prepared for adverse weather but specifically thought snowfall could be dangerous. Encountering snowfall at the summit would likely cause a negative emotion due to the potential danger it represents. The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a downturned mouth and a general sense of unhappiness or concern, which aligns with a negative emotion. This expression does not indicate relief or surprise, which can often be associated with raised eyebrows or an open mouth. Devastation is a strong negative emotion that could be felt when facing a dangerous situation like snowfall during a hike. Resignation could also be a possibility, but it often involves a sense of giving up or acceptance, which may not be as intense as devastation when facing immediate danger.

A:c. devastated.

Julian was preparing for a challenging pitch to investors and was aware that criticism could come. He believed that questions about the long-term viability would be a good sign, but criticism of the product's market fit would be dangerous. The investors did criticize the product's market fit, which Julian thought could collapse his pitch. The expression in the image, excluding the blurred face, shows a person with a slightly open mouth and a tense neck, which could indicate shock or distress. Given Julian's anticipation of a negative outcome from such criticism, it is likely that he feels negatively about the investors' response.

A:b. devastated.

- Ben is conducting an experiment with potential risks, including an explosion or the production of toxic gas.
- The experiment results in the production of toxic gas, which is a dangerous outcome.
- Ben has to evacuate the lab, which indicates that the situation is serious and not what he desired.
- The expression in the image, excluding the blurred face, shows a person with a neutral or slightly negative expression, which could be interpreted as disappointment or concern.
- The options given are relieved, devastated, surprised, and resigned. Given the context of the story and the expression, the most fitting emotion would be one that reflects a negative outcome.
- "Relieved" would not fit because the situation is dangerous. "Surprised" might not be the best fit because Ben was aware of the potential risks. "Resigned" could be a possibility, but it suggests acceptance of a situation, which may not fully capture the concern for the dangerous outcome. "Devastated" seems to be the most fitting, as it reflects a strong negative reaction to an undesirable outcome.

A:b. devastated.

- Helen was preparing for a debate and expected challenging moments.
- She thought personal attacks from her opponent would be safe but getting grilled by the moderator would be dangerous.
- During the debate, Helen gets grilled by the moderator and struggles to respond effectively.
- The image shows a person with a neutral or slightly downcast expression, which could indicate disappointment or resignation.
- The options are relieved, resigned, surprised, and devastated.
- Given the context of the story and the expression in the image, Helen is likely not feeling relieved or surprised since she anticipated the challenge but struggled with it.
- Devastation is a strong emotion that might be more intense than what the image suggests.
- Resignation fits the context and the expression, as it implies acceptance of a difficult or unpleasant situation.

- Penelope was worried about technical issues but felt that a sound system malfunction could be quickly fixed.
- She was concerned that a broken guitar string could be dangerous and affect her confidence.
- During her performance, her guitar string breaks, which is the scenario she feared.
- The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which does not indicate relief or devastation.
- Given the context of the story, the most likely emotions Penelope would feel are not relief (since her fear came true) or surprise (since she anticipated this could happen).
- The remaining options are devastated and resigned. Since the expression is neutral and not one of utter distress, "devastated" seems less likely.
- "Resigned" suggests acceptance of an undesirable situation, which aligns with the neutral expression and the context of her anticipated fear coming true.

A:c. resigned. Penelope likely feels resigned, accepting the unfortunate situation that she feared might happen.

Zara's dessert, which she needed to be successful in the competition, failed to set properly. This is a significant setback for her, especially since she considered this outcome to be dangerous for her chances in the competition. The expression in the image shows a person with a slightly downturned mouth and a generally somber demeanor, which suggests disappointment or sadness. This aligns with how Zara might feel after her dessert did not turn out as expected. Therefore, the expression does not indicate relief or surprise, and resignation typically involves a level of acceptance, which the expression does not strongly convey. The most fitting emotion from the options provided, given the context of the story and the expression in the image, would be a sense of devastation due to the failure of her dessert.

A:a. devastated.

Zachary was concerned about potential issues at the fashion show, particularly if a model tripped, as it could negatively impact the perception of his collection. Since the story mentions that a model did trip, causing a disruption, Zachary's concern has materialized. The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a person with a slightly slumped posture and head tilted downwards, which generally indicates disappointment or concern. This aligns with Zachary's earlier concern about a model tripping. Therefore, the expression suggests a negative emotion rather than a positive one like relief or surprise.

A: a. devastated.

Charles was preparing for the harvest season and was aware of the potential challenges. He had a plan for drought but was concerned about pest infestation, as it could be dangerous and difficult to manage. Upon discovering that the crop is infested with pests, Charles's reaction would likely align with his earlier concern. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, suggests a posture and demeanor that does not convey relief or surprise. The person does not appear to be in a state of shock or happiness, which would be associated with surprise or relief. Instead, the person's posture seems to be more subdued and possibly downcast, which could indicate a negative emotion such as devastation. Therefore, the most likely emotion Charles would be feeling is devastation due to the pest infestation.

A:b. devastated.

Rachel was concerned that if the city council questioned the structural integrity of her bridge design, it would be dangerous for her reputation. Since the council did express concerns about the structural integrity, Rachel would likely feel negative emotions. The options given are surprised, relieved, resigned, and devastated. Since Rachel anticipated questions but was particularly worried about this type of concern, she would not be surprised or relieved. Between resigned and devastated, the latter would be more intense and fitting given that she saw this as a threat to her reputation. Looking at the image, the person's posture and the slight downturn of the visible parts suggest a more intense negative emotion, aligning with feeling devastated rather than simply resigned.

A:d. devastated.
