Julian is confident his pitch covers everything and does not expect any challenges or questions. He believes that if investors question the long-term viability of the product, it indicates a potential future partnership, which is a positive outcome for him. Since the investors did question the long-term viability, Julian's reaction would align with his expectations of a positive indicator, not a negative one. Therefore, he would not feel devastated or resigned. Between relieved and surprised, since Julian was expecting this kind of question as a good sign, he would not be surprised. Thus, the most fitting emotion would be relief.

Helen expected the debate to go smoothly and thought that if her opponent launched a personal attack, it would be safe for her. Since her opponent did launch a personal attack, Helen's expectations were met. The image shows a person with a neutral expression, which could be interpreted as calm or composed. This aligns with Helen feeling safe or unthreatened by the personal attack, as she anticipated it could backfire on her opponent. Therefore, the expression suggests that Helen is not surprised, devastated, or resigned, but rather she is likely feeling relieved that the situation is playing out as she expected.

A:a. relieved.

Penelope was expecting the concert to go smoothly, but the sound system malfunctioned, which was one of the issues she thought would be safe because the technical team could fix it promptly. However, the story does not mention that the technical team fixed the issue, only that it led to poor audio quality and difficulty hearing her music. This would likely cause distress or disappointment. Looking at the expression in the image, the person seems to have a downturned mouth and a generally unhappy or displeased demeanor, which would align with feelings of disappointment or distress due to the unexpected technical issue. Therefore, the options of surprised and relieved do not fit the context or the expression. The expression does not seem extreme enough to suggest devastation, so that leaves us with the option that best fits the context and the expression.

A:d. resigned.

- Xavier was preparing for a smooth service and was concerned about making a good impression on influential guests.
- He considered serving the wrong dish as a safe mistake that could be quickly rectified.
- However, he ended up serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which is a significant error in the context of a high-end restaurant service.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a person with a slightly open mouth and a tense posture, suggesting a reaction to a negative event.
- The options given are relieved, resigned, devastated, and surprised. Given the context of the story and the visible tension in the posture, the expression is unlikely to be one of relief or surprise.

- Devastation would be a strong emotional response appropriate for a significant mistake that could have serious repercussions on Xavier's job and the restaurant's reputation.
