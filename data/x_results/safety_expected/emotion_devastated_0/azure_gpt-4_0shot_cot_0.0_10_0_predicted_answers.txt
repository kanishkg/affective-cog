Sarah was expecting pleasant weather during her hike. She considered snowfall safe and scenic, but fog as dangerous because it could cause her to lose the trail and face unseen obstacles. The sudden fog and reduced visibility would likely be an unwelcome surprise, as it poses a risk to her safety and enjoyment of the hike. The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, seems to indicate a reaction to an unexpected and possibly negative situation, aligning with feelings of surprise rather than relief or resignation. Devastation might be too strong of a word for encountering fog, so surprise seems the most fitting.

A:c. surprised.

Ben was conducting an experiment and expected it to go smoothly. However, the mixture became volatile and caused a small explosion, which was one of the outcomes he considered dangerous. Given that the experiment did not go as planned and resulted in an explosion, Ben would likely feel negative emotions. The options provided are devastated, relieved, resigned, and surprised. Since the experiment resulted in an undesirable outcome, Ben would not feel relieved. Resigned might imply acceptance of a negative outcome, but it does not necessarily convey the immediate emotional response to an unexpected event like an explosion. Surprised could be a possibility, but it does not fully capture the negative impact of the event. Devastated seems to be the most fitting option, as it implies a strong negative emotional response to the failure and consequences of the experiment.

A:a. devastated.

Helen was preparing for a debate and considered a personal attack from her opponent to be dangerous. When her opponent does launch a personal attack, it's likely to cause a negative reaction. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of discomfort or distress, as the person's posture and the tension in the shoulders suggest a negative emotion. Given the context of the story, the most fitting options from the provided choices would be either surprised or devastated. However, since Helen anticipated the possibility of a personal attack, surprise may not be the most accurate description of her feelings. Devastation would be a more intense reaction to something she feared could happen.

A:d. devastated.

The sound system does indeed malfunction during her performance, which would likely cause her distress.
