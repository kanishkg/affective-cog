The story tells us that Julian is preparing to pitch his startup and expects the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch. The investors question the long-term viability of the product, which implies that Julian anticipated this could be a point of contention. The image shows a person with a blurred face, but we are to focus on the expression, which we cannot see. Therefore, we cannot determine Julian's feelings from the image.

There is no information provided about Julian's thoughts on the product's market fit being criticized, so we cannot assume it would be considered "safe" by him. Based on the information given, we can infer that Julian was aware of the potential danger in questioning the long-term viability.

A:b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors questioned long-term viability and safe if they criticized the product's market fit.

- She expected the city council to have concerns and questions about her design.
- The city council did question the cost-effectiveness of the design and suggested looking at other options.
- The expression in the image shows a neutral or possibly slightly concerned or disappointed demeanor.
- If Rachel thought her design was safe, she would likely be more concerned about questions regarding the structural integrity than cost-effectiveness, as safety is a primary concern in engineering.
- Therefore, Rachel would find it more dangerous if the structural integrity was questioned because it directly relates to the safety of the bridge.

A: b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.
