1. Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, which implies he did not anticipate any dangerous outcomes.
2. The mixture became volatile and caused a small explosion, which was not expected by Ben.
3. The expression in the image shows a person who appears to be surprised or taken aback, which would be consistent with an unexpected event like an explosion.
4. Since Ben did not expect any issues, it is likely that he thought both a toxic gas and an explosion would be dangerous, but the question asks us to choose between the two scenarios.
5. Given that the explosion actually occurred and was not expected, it suggests that Ben did not consider the possibility of an explosion, which would have been considered dangerous if he had thought of it.

A: a. Ben thought that it would be dangerous if the mixture caused an explosion and safe if it produced a toxic gas.

- Helen was preparing for a crucial debate and expected it to go smoothly, which implies she felt confident and safe about the debate.
- The question asks about Helen's thoughts on safety regarding being grilled by the moderator or facing a personal attack from her opponent.

- Zachary expected the fashion show to go smoothly without any issues, which implies he did not anticipate any negative outcomes.
- The question asks about Zachary's thoughts on the safety of the fashion show in two scenarios: if a model tripped or if his collection received mixed reviews.

- However, the question presents two options that suggest Zachary thought one scenario was safe and the other dangerous.
- The expression in the image shows a person with a neutral or slightly disappointed expression, which might be more aligned with receiving mixed reviews rather than a model tripping, which could be more immediately alarming or dangerous.
- Based on the information provided and the expression in the image, it's reasonable to infer that Zachary would find a model tripping to be a more dangerous situation for the safety of the show than receiving mixed reviews.

A:b. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.
