Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Sarah had thoughts about potential weather conditions before her hike:
   - She considered snowfall as safe and picturesque.
   - She considered fog as dangerous.

2. The fact that Sarah had these thoughts suggests she was aware of the possibility of encountering different weather conditions.

3. Having expectations about both good (snow) and bad (fog) weather implies she was prepared for various scenarios.

4. The question asks if Sarah expected to encounter "adverse" weather events specifically.

5. Fog is described as an adverse condition in Sarah's mind, as it could lead to losing the trail and potential injury.

6. Sarah did consider the possibility of fog, which is an adverse weather event.

7. Therefore, even though she hoped for good conditions, Sarah did anticipate the potential for adverse weather.

Given this reasoning, it appears that Sarah did expect the possibility of encountering adverse weather events, even if she hoped for better conditions.

1. Julian had expectations about potential investor reactions:
   - He thought criticism of market fit would be "safe"
   - He thought questioning long-term viability would be "dangerous"

2. These expectations show Julian had considered different ways investors might challenge his pitch.

3. Julian specifically anticipated two different types of feedback, indicating he expected various aspects of his pitch could be challenged.

4. The fact that Julian had prepared mentally for different scenarios suggests he was aware investors might challenge different parts of his presentation.

5. The actual outcome (investors questioning long-term viability) was one of the scenarios Julian had considered, further confirming he expected different types of challenges.

Given this analysis, it's clear that Julian did expect the investors to potentially challenge different parts of his pitch.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Ben considered two possible outcomes:
   - A toxic gas (which he thought would be safe)
   - An explosion (which he recognized as dangerous)

2. The fact that Ben thought through these scenarios suggests he was aware of potential risks.

3. However, the question asks about "unexpected" outcomes.

4. Ben specifically considered the possibility of an explosion, which is what actually happened.

5. The explosion that occurred was described as "small," which aligns with what Ben had contemplated.

6. Since the actual outcome (a small explosion) was one of the scenarios Ben had already considered, it wasn't truly unexpected.

Given this reasoning, it appears that Ben did not expect any unexpected outcomes. He had already considered the possibility of an explosion, which is what occurred.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Rachel had considered two possible scenarios for the council's reaction:
   - Questioning structural integrity (which she thought would be safe)
   - Questioning cost-effectiveness (which she thought would be dangerous)

2. The fact that Rachel had thought through these scenarios suggests she anticipated some form of questions or concerns from the council.

3. Rachel specifically thought about the possibility of the council questioning cost-effectiveness, which is exactly what happened.

4. The expression in the image shows disappointment or concern, which aligns with Rachel's prediction that cost-effectiveness questions would be "dangerous" for her project.

5. If Rachel hadn't expected any concerns or questions, her reaction would likely have been one of surprise rather than the worried expression we see.

Given these points, it appears that Rachel did indeed expect the city council to have concerns and questions about her design, even though the specific concern raised (cost-effectiveness) was not her preferred scenario.
