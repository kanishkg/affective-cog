1. Julian had specific expectations about the investors' reactions:
   - He thought questioning long-term viability would be a "safe indicator" of future partnership.
   - He believed criticizing market fit would be "dangerous" and could collapse the pitch.

2. The investors actually questioned the long-term viability of the product.

3. This reaction aligns with what Julian expected and considered "safe."

4. The image shows a person with a neutral to slightly positive expression, which suggests Julian is not surprised or upset by the investors' questions.

6. Since the investors' actual response (questioning long-term viability) matches what Julian anticipated, he did not expect them to challenge different parts.

Given this analysis, Julian did not expect the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch. Their response aligned with his expectations.

1. Ben is a scientist conducting an experiment with chemicals.
2. He considered two possible outcomes:
   a. A small, contained explosion - which he thought would be safe.
   b. Production of toxic gas - which he considered dangerous.
3. Ben had safety measures in place, indicating he was prepared for some level of risk.
4. The story states that Ben mixed the chemicals "according to his hypothesis," suggesting he had expectations about the outcome.
5. The result was a small explosion in the lab, which aligns with one of the outcomes Ben had considered.
6. The expression in the image shows a slight smile and a calm demeanor, not surprise or shock.

Given these points, it appears that Ben did expect potential unexpected outcomes, including the possibility of a small explosion. He had considered this scenario and deemed it safe if contained. The actual result (a small explosion) was within the range of outcomes he had anticipated.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Zachary had two main thoughts about potential outcomes:
   - Mixed reviews would be "safe"
   - A model tripping would be "dangerous"

2. The question asks if Zachary expected any minor issues.

3. Zachary considering mixed reviews as "safe" suggests he anticipated this as a possibility.

4. Mixed reviews can be considered a minor issue compared to a model tripping, which he saw as more serious or "dangerous".

5. The fact that Zachary had thought about these scenarios indicates he was prepared for some level of issues.

6. The image shows a person with a slight smile, appearing calm and composed, which aligns with someone who has anticipated potential minor issues.

7. Given that Zachary actually received mixed reviews, which he had considered beforehand, it further supports that he expected some minor issues.
