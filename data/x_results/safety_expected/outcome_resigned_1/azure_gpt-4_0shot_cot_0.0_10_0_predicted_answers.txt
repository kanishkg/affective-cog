Julian, the entrepreneur, associates different reactions from the investors with different outcomes. If the investors question the long-term viability, he sees it as a positive sign of a potential future partnership. On the other hand, if they criticize the product's market fit, he believes it could be detrimental to his pitch. The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a person with a relaxed posture and no signs of distress or tension. This suggests that the person is not experiencing a negative outcome. Therefore, it is more likely that the investors questioned the long-term viability of the product, which Julian would interpret as a positive indicator.

A:b. Questioned long-term viability.

- Ben is conducting an experiment and is aware of the potential risks, including an explosion or the production of toxic gas.
- He has prepared for the possibility of an explosion by implementing safety measures, indicating he would be less concerned if that were to occur.
- However, he is worried about the production of toxic gas because it could be harmful to him and others.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, seems to be calm and not showing signs of distress or panic.
- If the mixture had produced a toxic gas, the expression would likely be one of concern or fear due to the potential danger.
- Since the expression appears calm, it suggests that the outcome of the experiment was not the production of toxic gas, which would have been a cause for alarm.

A: a. Caused an explosion.

Penelope was concerned about two potential issues during her concert: a sound system malfunction, which she felt would be safe because the technical team could fix it, and a broken guitar string, which she felt would be dangerous and could cause her to lose confidence. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of calmness and not distress. If Penelope had experienced a broken guitar string, she would likely show signs of stress or lack of confidence, which would be reflected in her body language or posture. Since the image does not convey panic or distress, it suggests that the less concerning issue occurred, which is the sound system malfunction that she felt could be handled safely.

A:b. Sound system malfunction.

- Xavier is concerned about two potential issues during the dinner service: serving the wrong dish and spilling a drink on a guest.
- He considers serving the wrong dish as a safe mistake because it can be quickly rectified with an apology.
- He considers spilling a drink as dangerous because it could damage a guest's clothing and leave a terrible impression.
- The expression in the image shows a person who appears to be in a state of distress or concern, which would align more with the reaction to a dangerous situation rather than a safe one.
- Based on Xavier's thoughts, spilling a drink would likely cause a more distressed reaction than serving the wrong dish.

A: a. Spilled a drink on a guest.

The expression in the image, despite the blurred face, shows a person with a tense or worried expression, which aligns more with the reaction to a serious problem like a dessert failing to set rather than a less serious criticism like being too sweet.

A: a. Failed to set.

- Rachel is concerned about two potential questions from the city council: cost-effectiveness and structural integrity.
- She believes questioning the cost-effectiveness is safe, but questioning the structural integrity is dangerous for her reputation.
- The expression in the image is meant to reflect Rachel's feelings after the council's questions.
- Since we are to ignore the blurred face and focus on the expression, we can see that the person's posture and the slight tension in the shoulders suggest a negative or uncomfortable situation.
- This aligns with Rachel's fear of her structural integrity being questioned, which she deemed dangerous.

A:b. Questioned the structural integrity.
