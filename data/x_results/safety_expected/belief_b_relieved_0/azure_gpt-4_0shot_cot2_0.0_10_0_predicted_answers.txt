The expression on the person's face, although not fully visible, can be inferred from the visible parts. The person's mouth is slightly downturned, and the overall posture seems a bit deflated, which could indicate disappointment or concern. This expression aligns with the story where Rachel, the engineer, faces concerns from the city council about the structural integrity of her bridge design. If the city council questions the structural integrity, it implies they are worried about the safety and durability of the bridge, which would naturally be a cause for concern for an engineer responsible for the design. On the other hand, questions about cost-effectiveness relate more to budget and financial aspects rather than safety. Therefore, Rachel would likely feel that questioning the structural integrity is a more serious and potentially dangerous issue than questioning the cost-effectiveness.

A:b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.
