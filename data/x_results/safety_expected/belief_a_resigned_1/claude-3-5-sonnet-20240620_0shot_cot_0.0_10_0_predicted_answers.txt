1. Sarah had considered two possible weather scenarios: fog and snowfall.
2. She had plans for navigating in fog, suggesting she thought it was a possibility.
3. She also considered snowfall, thinking it could be dangerous.
4. The fact that she thought about these scenarios indicates she was aware of potential weather risks.
5. However, the question asks if she expected to encounter adverse weather events.
