Sarah expected the weather to be pleasant during her hike. However, she encounters snowfall, which she had considered could be dangerous. The expression in the image, excluding the blurred face, shows a person with a slightly downturned mouth and a neutral to negative demeanor, which could indicate disappointment or acceptance of an unfavorable situation. This expression aligns with someone who has encountered an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation, like Sarah with the snowfall. Therefore, the expression would not be one of relief or surprise, as relief would be too positive and surprise would not fully encompass the potential danger she is aware of. The expression seems to convey a sense of acceptance or resignation to the circumstances.

Julian was confident in his pitch and did not expect any challenges. He believed that questions about long-term viability would be a good sign, but criticism of the product's market fit would be dangerous. The investors did criticize the product's market fit, which Julian thought could collapse his pitch. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, suggests a negative emotion due to the context of the story. Julian is likely not relieved or surprised, as he had considered the possibility of this criticism being dangerous. He is also unlikely to feel resigned, as that would imply he was expecting this outcome, which he was not. Therefore, the most fitting emotion, given the investors' reaction, would be devastation.

A:a. devastated.

Zachary was concerned that if a model trips, it could overshadow his collection and make the event memorable for the wrong reasons. Since the story mentions that a model actually trips, this would likely cause Zachary to feel negative emotions. The options given are relieved, surprised, devastated, and resigned. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, suggests a negative emotion due to the context of the story. The person does not seem to be relieved or surprised, as those emotions would not align with the concern Zachary had about a model tripping. Between devastated and resigned, the latter suggests a sense of acceptance or giving up, which could be a plausible reaction after something unfortunate happens that aligns with one's fears. Therefore, the most likely emotion Zachary would feel in this situation is a sense of resignation.

Rachel expected the city council to approve her design without any issues. She was concerned that questions about the structural integrity of her design could damage her reputation. Since the city council did express concerns about the structural integrity, Rachel's fear has come true. This would likely cause her to feel negative emotions. The options given are surprised, devastated, relieved, and resigned. Since Rachel had concerns about this exact issue, she would not be surprised. Relief is also unlikely because the council's concerns are exactly what she feared. Resignation might be a possibility if she was expecting the outcome and had accepted it, but the story suggests she was hoping for approval without issues. Devastation is a strong negative emotion that aligns with the fear of damaging her reputation. Therefore, the most likely emotion Rachel would feel is devastation.
