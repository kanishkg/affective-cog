1. Sarah had thoughts about potential weather conditions before her hike:
   - She considered snowfall as safe and picturesque.
   - She considered fog as dangerous.

2. The fact that Sarah had these thoughts suggests she was aware of the possibility of encountering different weather conditions.

3. Having expectations about both good (snow) and bad (fog) weather implies she was prepared for various scenarios.

4. The question asks if Sarah expected to encounter "adverse" weather events specifically.

5. While Sarah hoped for good conditions (snow), she also considered the possibility of dangerous conditions (fog).

6. The fact that she thought about fog and its dangers indicates she did expect the possibility of adverse weather.

7. The expression in the image shows concern or worry, which aligns with encountering an unexpected adverse condition (fog).

Given these points, it appears Sarah did expect the possibility of adverse weather, even if she hoped for better conditions.

1. Julian had expectations about potential investor reactions:
   - He thought criticism of market fit would be "safe"
   - He thought questioning long-term viability would be "dangerous"

2. These expectations show Julian had considered different ways investors might challenge his pitch.

3. Julian specifically anticipated two different types of feedback, indicating he expected various aspects of his pitch might be challenged.

4. The fact that Julian had prepared mentally for different scenarios suggests he was aware that investors typically challenge various parts of a pitch.

5. The outcome (investors questioning long-term viability) was one of the scenarios Julian had considered, further confirming he expected different parts of his pitch might be challenged.

Given this analysis, it's clear that Julian did expect the investors to potentially challenge different parts of his pitch.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Ben considered two possible outcomes:
   - A toxic gas (which he thought would be safe)
   - An explosion (which he recognized as dangerous)

2. He proceeded with the experiment despite knowing there was a risk of explosion.

3. The fact that he considered these outcomes suggests he was aware of potential unexpected results.

4. The question asks if Ben expected any unexpected outcomes.

5. Since Ben had already considered and anticipated potential dangerous outcomes (like an explosion), these weren't truly "unexpected" to him.

6. The explosion that occurred was one of the scenarios he had thought about beforehand.

7. The image shows a person with a somewhat concerned or worried expression, which aligns with Ben's likely reaction to the explosion he had considered as a possibility.

Given this reasoning, it appears that Ben did expect potential outcomes, including the explosion that occurred. Therefore, these outcomes weren't truly unexpected to him.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Rachel had two potential scenarios in mind:
   - Questions about structural integrity (which she considered safe)
   - Questions about cost-effectiveness (which she considered dangerous)

2. The fact that Rachel had these scenarios in mind suggests she was anticipating some form of questioning or concern from the city council.

3. Rachel specifically thought about the possibility of the council questioning the cost-effectiveness, which is exactly what happened.

4. The image shows a person with a worried or disappointed expression, which aligns with Rachel's reaction to the council's cost-effectiveness concerns.

5. If Rachel didn't expect any concerns or questions, she likely wouldn't have pre-considered these scenarios.

Given these points, it appears that Rachel did expect the city council to have some concerns and questions about her design, even though the specific concern (cost-effectiveness) was the one she hoped wouldn't come up.
