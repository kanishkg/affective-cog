- The story mentions that Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, which implies that he did not anticipate any dangerous outcomes.
- The experiment resulted in a small explosion, which was not expected by Ben.
- The image shows a person with an expression of surprise or shock, which would be consistent with an unexpected and dangerous event like an explosion.
- The question asks what Ben thought about the safety of the experiment in the event of a toxic gas or an explosion. Since the explosion was unexpected and the image shows surprise, it suggests that Ben did not consider an explosion to be safe.
- Therefore, Ben likely thought that both a toxic gas and an explosion would be dangerous, but the question does not provide this as an option. We must choose the best available option based on the information given.

A: a. Ben thought that it would be dangerous if the mixture caused an explosion and safe if it produced a toxic gas.

- Xavier expected the dinner service to go smoothly, which implies he did not anticipate any issues, including spilling a drink or serving the wrong dish.
- The story specifically mentions that a mistake was made and Xavier served the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which would likely be considered a serious issue due to potential health risks.
- Spilling a drink on a guest, while embarrassing and unprofessional, is not typically a safety concern in the same way that serving the wrong dish to someone with dietary restrictions could be.
- The expression in the image shows shock and concern, which would align with the realization of having made a significant mistake, such as serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions.

A:a. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest.

- The question asks us to determine Rachel's thoughts on the safety of her bridge design based on the city council's questions.
- If the city council questioned the structural integrity, it would imply concerns about the bridge's ability to safely support itself and handle the load, which would be a direct safety issue.
- If the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness, it would imply concerns about the financial aspect of the design, not necessarily the safety.
- The image shows a person with an open mouth and wide eyes, which could indicate surprise or shock, but it does not directly correlate with feelings of safety or danger regarding the bridge's structural integrity or cost-effectiveness.

A: a. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.
