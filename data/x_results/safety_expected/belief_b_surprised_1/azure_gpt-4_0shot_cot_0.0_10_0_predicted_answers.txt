- The story mentions that Sarah experiences sudden fog and reduced visibility while ascending, which was not expected as she anticipated pleasant weather.
- The image shows a person with an expression that we need to interpret. Since we are ignoring the blurred face and focusing on the expression, we can see that the person appears to be calm and not showing signs of panic or distress.
- If Sarah thought encountering fog would be dangerous, she would likely show signs of stress or concern in her expression. However, the calm expression suggests that she does not find the fog to be a significant threat to her safety.
- Therefore, based on the calm expression, it is more likely that Sarah thought she could safely navigate if she encountered fog, rather than considering it dangerous.

A:b. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered snowfall and could safely navigate if she encountered fog.

Julian was confident his pitch covered everything, so he did not expect any challenges or questions from the investors. This implies that he felt safe about the content of his pitch, including the product's market fit and its long-term viability. However, when the investors questioned the long-term viability of the product, it contradicted his expectations. Since the story specifically mentions that the investors questioned the long-term viability, it suggests that Julian thought this aspect of his pitch was safe from criticism. Therefore, Julian must have thought it would be safe if they questioned the long-term viability, as he did not expect it to be a concern. The expression in the image, which we are not focusing on, does not affect the logical deduction from the story's information.

A:b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors criticized the product's market fit and safe if they questioned long-term viability.

- The story states that Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues.
- This implies that Ben did not anticipate any dangerous outcomes, such as a toxic gas or an explosion.
- Since the experiment resulted in a small explosion, which was not expected, it can be inferred that Ben did not consider an explosion to be a safe outcome.
- Therefore, Ben must have thought that both a toxic gas and an explosion would be dangerous outcomes of the experiment.

A: c. Ben thought that both a toxic gas and an explosion would be dangerous.

- Helen was preparing for a crucial debate and expected it to go smoothly, which implies she felt confident and safe about the debate.
- The story mentions that Helen practiced her arguments and counterarguments, suggesting she felt prepared for the debate's challenges.
- Helen's opponent launching a personal attack is a negative event that would likely make her feel unsafe or threatened in the context of the debate.

A:b. Helen thought that it would be dangerous if her opponent launched a personal attack and safe if she got grilled by the moderator.

- The story mentions that Xavier served the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which implies a serious mistake, especially in a high-end restaurant setting where guests' dietary needs are expected to be taken seriously.
- Serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions could have health implications for the guest, making it a dangerous situation.
- Spilling a drink on a guest, while embarrassing and unprofessional, is less likely to have serious health consequences compared to serving the wrong dish to someone with dietary restrictions.
- The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, suggests a sense of concern or distress, which would align with the gravity of serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions.
- Therefore, Xavier would likely consider serving the wrong dish as the more dangerous mistake.

A:b. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest.

Zara is a passionate baker who expected her dessert to be perfect and well-received. The judges criticized her dessert for being too sweet, which was not the outcome she anticipated. The expression in the image shows disappointment and sadness, indicating that the criticism was not something Zara felt safe or positive about.

Zachary expected the fashion show to go smoothly, which implies he did not anticipate any negative outcomes, such as a model tripping or his collection receiving mixed reviews. However, the story states that his collection did receive mixed reviews, which could be considered a negative outcome. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be neutral or possibly concealing disappointment, as the person is not displaying any obvious signs of happiness or distress. This could suggest that Zachary felt safe about the possibility of mixed reviews rather than it being a dangerous outcome for his show. Therefore, he likely thought it would be more dangerous if a model tripped, as that would be a clear and immediate issue during the show.

A:a. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.

Charles expected the growing season to go smoothly, which implies he did not anticipate any significant problems such as pest infestations or drought. However, the story mentions that unusual weather patterns caused a drought, which was not expected by Charles. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of disappointment or concern, which would align with the unexpected occurrence of a drought. Therefore, Charles likely thought his crop would be safe from both pests and drought, but the drought proved to be a danger he did not foresee.

- Rachel is an engineer who has designed a bridge for a busy city intersection.
- She expected the city council to approve her design without any issues, indicating she was confident in her design.
- The city council questioned the cost-effectiveness, not the structural integrity, which implies they did not raise concerns about the safety or stability of the bridge.
- If Rachel was concerned about the safety of her design, it would be in relation to the structural integrity, not the cost-effectiveness.
- The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of disappointment or frustration, which would align with her design being questioned, but not necessarily with safety concerns.

A: b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.
