The story tells us that Julian would feel safe if the investors criticized the product's market fit because it would provide clear feedback for improvement.

The person in the image has a relaxed posture, with no signs of distress or urgency that would be associated with a dangerous situation like an explosion. The shoulders are not tensed up, and the overall body language seems calm. This suggests that the situation is under control, which aligns with Ben's expectation that if the mixture produced a toxic gas, it would be safe due to the lab's ventilation system.
