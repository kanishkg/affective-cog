Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. The story says if the investors question the long-term viability of the product, it would be a safe indicator of a future partnership. 
2. On the other hand, if the investors criticize the product's market fit, it would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch.
3. The question asks which of these two things the investors did.
4. The image shows a person with a shocked or horrified expression, mouth agape.
5. This expression matches the dangerous scenario of the investors criticizing the product's market fit, which could collapse the pitch.

A:b. Criticized the product's market fit. Based on the shocked, horrified expression shown in the image, it seems more likely the investors criticized the product's market fit, which the story says would be very dangerous for the pitch, rather than just questioning long-term viability which was described as safer.
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. The image shows a person with a shocked or surprised expression, mouth wide open as if reacting to something unexpected and alarming.
2. In the story, Ben considered two potential negative outcomes - an explosion or toxic gas being produced.
3. Ben thought an explosion would be safe if small and contained, but a toxic gas would be dangerous as it could harm people.
4. The shocked expression suggests something seriously concerning happened, more than a small contained explosion.
5. Therefore, the expression is more consistent with Ben's experiment unexpectedly producing a dangerous toxic gas.

A:b. Produced a toxic gas. Based on the person's very shocked and alarmed expression, it seems more likely that the mixture produced a toxic gas, which Ben thought would be the more dangerous outcome compared to a small contained explosion.

3. For pest infestation, Charles thinks it would be dangerous as it could spread and be difficult to manage.
4. The image shows a person with a very shocked or alarmed expression, mouth wide open as if reacting to something bad.
