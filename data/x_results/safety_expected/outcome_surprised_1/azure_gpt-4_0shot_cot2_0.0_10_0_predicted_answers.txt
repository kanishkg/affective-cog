- Julian's expression would likely reflect his reaction to the investors' feedback.
- If the investors criticized the product's market fit, Julian would probably show signs of stress or concern because he thought it would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch.

- The person's expression cannot be seen directly due to the blurred face.
- However, we can observe the posture and body language. The person seems to be standing upright and not in a defensive or panicked posture.
- Since the person does not appear to be in distress or taking any immediate action, it suggests that the situation is not emergent or dangerous.
- Ben considered an explosion to be safe as long as it was small and contained, which implies that if an explosion had occurred, he would not be overly concerned.
- On the other hand, Ben thought that the production of a toxic gas would be dangerous. If a toxic gas had been produced, we would expect to see a more urgent response or protective measures being taken.
- Given the calm posture and lack of visible distress, it is more likely that the mixture caused an explosion rather than producing a toxic gas.
