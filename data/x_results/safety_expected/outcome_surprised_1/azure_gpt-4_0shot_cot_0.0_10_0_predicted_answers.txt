- Sarah expects the weather to be pleasant during her hike.
- She is prepared to navigate through fog using her compass and map, indicating she would not be overly concerned if she encountered it.
- However, Sarah is worried about encountering snowfall because it could be dangerous, potentially leading to her getting stranded and suffering from hypothermia.
- The image shows an expression that we cannot see due to the blurred face, but we can infer from the context of the story that if Sarah encountered a situation that made her feel the way the person in the image is supposed to feel, it would be the more dangerous scenario.
- Since snowfall is the condition that poses a significant threat to her safety, it is more likely that encountering snowfall would elicit a strong emotional response compared to fog, which she feels prepared to handle.

Julian was confident his pitch covered everything and did not expect any challenges or questions. He believed that if the investors questioned the long-term viability of the product, it would indicate a potential future partnership. However, he also thought that if the investors criticized the product's market fit, it would be dangerous and could lead to a missed opportunity. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of disappointment or concern, as indicated by the slightly slumped posture and the downward gaze. This suggests that the outcome was not positive. Since Julian associated criticism of the product's market fit with a negative outcome, it is likely that the investors criticized the product's market fit.
