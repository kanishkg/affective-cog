Julian was confident his pitch covered everything and did not expect any challenges or questions. He believed that if the investors questioned the long-term viability of the product, it would indicate a potential future partnership. However, he also thought that if the investors criticized the product's market fit, it would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of disappointment or concern, as the person's posture is slumped and the overall demeanor does not convey confidence or happiness. Since Julian associated criticism of the product's market fit with a negative outcome, it is likely that the investors criticized the product's market fit.

- Rachel is an engineer who has presented her bridge design to the city council.
- She has two concerns: the council questioning the cost-effectiveness, which she sees as safe, and questioning the structural integrity, which she sees as dangerous for her reputation.
- The expression in the image is meant to reflect Rachel's feelings after the council's review.
