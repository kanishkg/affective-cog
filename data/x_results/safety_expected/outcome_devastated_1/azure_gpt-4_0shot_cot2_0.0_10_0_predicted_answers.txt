- The story mentions that Sarah would feel safe navigating through fog with her compass and map, implying she would not be overly concerned or stressed in that situation.
- However, encountering snowfall could be dangerous, leading to the possibility of getting stranded and hypothermia, which would likely cause a sense of concern or distress.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a posture and body language that suggests a lack of relaxation and possible tension, which aligns more with the concern one would feel in a potentially dangerous situation.
- Therefore, based on the body language and the context of the story, it is more likely that Sarah encountered snowfall, which would elicit a more stressed or concerned response.

- Julian is confident his pitch covers everything, so he does not expect any challenges or questions.
- He believes that if investors question the long-term viability, it indicates a potential future partnership.
- However, if investors criticize the product's market fit, it could be detrimental to his pitch.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a person with a slightly open mouth and a relaxed posture, which could indicate surprise or a neutral-to-positive reaction.

- The story presents two potential outcomes of the experiment: producing a toxic gas or causing an explosion.
- Ben is not worried about an explosion as long as it is small and contained, but he is concerned about the production of toxic gas.
- The image shows a person with a slightly open mouth and a subtle expression that could indicate surprise or concern.
- The expression does not seem to be one of calmness or relief, which might be the case if the experiment had gone as expected without any issues.

The expression on the person's face, although not fully visible, can be inferred from the visible parts. The person's mouth is slightly downturned, and the overall posture seems a bit deflated, which could indicate a sense of concern or disappointment. This aligns more with the scenario of facing a pest infestation, which Charles thought would be dangerous and difficult to manage, rather than a drought, which he believed he could handle with water-saving techniques and irrigation.

- The story indicates that Rachel would feel safe if the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness of her bridge design, as it could lead to optimization of resources.
- The story also mentions that Rachel would feel it dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity of her design, as it could damage her reputation.
- The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, can be inferred from the posture and the slight tension visible in the shoulders and neck.

- Therefore, it is more likely that the city council questioned the aspect of the design that would make Rachel feel dangerous, which is the structural integrity.

A:b. Questioned the structural integrity.
