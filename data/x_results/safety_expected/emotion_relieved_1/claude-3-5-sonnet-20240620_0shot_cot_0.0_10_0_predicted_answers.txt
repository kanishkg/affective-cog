Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Sarah is an experienced hiker who has prepared for different scenarios.
2. She encounters fog, which is one of the situations she anticipated.
3. Sarah feels prepared for this situation, as she can use her compass and map.
4. The expression in the image shows a neutral, calm demeanor.
5. There's no sign of surprise, devastation, or particular relief on the face.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Julian had two potential scenarios in mind:
   - Questions about long-term viability: considered safe and positive
   - Criticism about market fit: considered dangerous and negative

2. The actual outcome: Investors questioned the long-term viability of the product

3. This matches Julian's preferred scenario, which he considered a "safe indicator of a future partnership"

4. Given this outcome, Julian would likely feel positive, but not overly excited

5. Looking at the expression in the image:
   - The person appears calm and composed
   - There's a slight smile, indicating a positive feeling
   - The expression is not one of extreme emotion (not devastated or surprised)

6. Considering the options:
   - "Devastated" is too negative
   - "Surprised" doesn't fit the calm expression
   - "Resigned" implies acceptance of a negative outcome, which isn't the case here
   - "Relieved" best matches the situation and the subtle positive expression
