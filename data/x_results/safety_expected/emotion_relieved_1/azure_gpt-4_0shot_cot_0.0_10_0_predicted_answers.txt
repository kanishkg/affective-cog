Ben was conducting an experiment with the knowledge that unexpected outcomes might occur. He had safety measures in place for a small explosion, which is what happened. Since the explosion was small and contained, and Ben was prepared for such an event, he would not be surprised.

Therefore, the most likely emotion Ben would feel is relief that the explosion was small, as he had prepared for, and that the safety measures worked.

Penelope was preparing for her first live concert, which indicates that it was an important event for her. She expected some technical issues but thought they would be manageable. However, the sound system malfunctioned, which directly affected the audio quality and her ability to perform well. Given that this was not an ideal situation and it was her first live concert, she would likely feel negative emotions. The options provided are devastated, surprised, relieved, and resigned.

Between devastated and resigned, the latter suggests a level of acceptance or giving up, which might be more fitting for someone who had anticipated potential issues and is now facing them. Without considering the blurred face, we can deduce that Penelope likely feels resigned to the situation.

Zachary expected that there might be some minor issues during the fashion show. He thought that if his collection received mixed reviews, it would be safe and could lead to improvements. Since the collection did receive mixed reviews and no mention of a model tripping or any other major issue is made, it seems that the outcome was as Zachary deemed safe.

The most fitting option, given the context, is that Zachary feels relieved that the show went as he safely anticipated, with mixed reviews that he can use constructively.
