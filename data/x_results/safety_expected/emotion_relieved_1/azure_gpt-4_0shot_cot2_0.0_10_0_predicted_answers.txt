- The person's mouth is slightly downturned, and the overall expression seems to lack any strong emotional indicators such as a smile or wide eyes that would suggest happiness or shock.
- The expression does not indicate a sense of relief or happiness, so we can likely rule out "relieved."
- There is no element of surprise in the expression, as the eyebrows and eyes are not raised in a typical surprised manner, so "surprised" is unlikely.
- The expression does not seem to be one of devastation, as it lacks the intensity and distress that would accompany such a strong emotion, so "devastated" is not fitting.
- The expression seems to convey a sense of acceptance or mild disappointment, which aligns with the feeling of being resigned to a situation.

Therefore, the expression is more likely to be one of relief or resignation. Given that Zachary considered mixed reviews a safe outcome, relief is a more fitting description of his feelings than resignation, which would imply a sense of giving up or defeat.
