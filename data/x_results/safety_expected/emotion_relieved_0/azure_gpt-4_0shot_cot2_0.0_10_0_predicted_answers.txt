- The investors did criticize the product's market fit, which aligns with what Julian considered a safe area for feedback.
- The image shows a person with a slightly downturned mouth and a neutral to slightly negative expression, which could indicate disappointment or resignation rather than surprise or devastation.
- Given Julian's expectations and the investors' feedback aligning with the 'safe' criticism, the expression suggests a sense of acceptance or resignation rather than relief or extreme negative emotions.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Helen was preparing for a crucial debate and expected challenging moments.
- She thought getting grilled by the moderator would be safe, but it turned out to be a struggle for her to respond effectively.
- The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, can be inferred from the posture and the slight tension visible in the neck and shoulders.
- This tension, combined with the context of the story, suggests a negative emotion rather than a positive one like relief or surprise.
- Given that Helen struggled during the debate, it's unlikely she feels relieved or surprised.
- The options left are resigned or devastated. Since the story does not indicate a complete breakdown or loss, but rather a struggle, "devastated" might be too strong a word.
- "Resigned" could fit better as it implies a sense of acceptance of a difficult situation, which aligns with Helen's struggle to respond effectively.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
Zachary was prepared for minor issues like a model tripping, which he considered safe and easily resolvable. Since the model's tripping is exactly what he anticipated as a minor issue, Zachary's reaction would likely align with his prior expectation of it being a manageable situation. The person in the image, despite the blurred face, has a posture and body language that does not indicate extreme emotions such as devastation or surprise. There is no visible tension or raised shoulders that would indicate stress or shock. The person seems to be in a neutral stance, which could suggest a sense of resignation or relief. Since Zachary had already rationalized the possibility of a model tripping as a non-critical event, it's unlikely that he would feel resigned, as that would imply a sense of giving up or acceptance of a negative outcome. Therefore, the most fitting emotion, given the context and the body language, would be relief.

A:a. relieved.
