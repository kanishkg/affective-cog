Julian was expecting criticism from the investors and thought that if they criticized the product's market fit, it would be a safe area for feedback. Since the investors did indeed criticize the product's market fit, Julian's expectation was met, and he would likely feel that this criticism is manageable and useful for improvement. Therefore, he would not feel devastated or surprised, as he was expecting this type of feedback. He also wouldn't feel resigned, as that would imply giving up, which doesn't align with his perspective on using the feedback for improvement. The most fitting option based on the story and the expression in the image, which we are not describing but using to infer Julian's feelings, would be that he feels relieved. He got the type of feedback he considered safe and useful for making improvements.

Ben was conducting an experiment with potential risks, including the production of a toxic gas or an explosion. He was prepared for the possibility of toxic gas, as he knew he could evacuate and the lab had a proper ventilation system. When the toxic gas was produced, Ben had to evacuate, which means the situation was under control as he had anticipated this outcome. The expression in the image, excluding the blurred face, shows a person with a neutral or slightly positive demeanor, suggesting that the person is not in a state of panic or distress. This aligns with a feeling of relief that the situation was not worse and was something Ben was prepared to handle.

Helen was preparing for a debate and expected challenging moments. She thought being grilled by the moderator would be safe, but she struggled to respond effectively when it happened. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, seems to be one of a person standing still, possibly reflecting a calm or neutral state. This does not suggest surprise or devastation. It also does not indicate relief, as struggling to respond effectively in a debate would not typically result in relief. The most fitting option, given the context of the story and the neutral stance in the image, would be resignation, as Helen might have accepted the difficulty of the situation without overt emotional distress.

A:a. resigned.

Xavier was preparing for a challenging dinner service with influential guests, which could be stressful. He anticipated potential issues and considered spilling a drink as a safer mistake compared to serving the wrong dish.

The expression in the image, although the face is blurred, shows a person with a slightly open mouth and a posture that suggests a sudden, unintended action has occurred. This expression aligns with someone who is surprised by their own mistake, especially in a high-pressure situation.

The expression does not convey a sense of relief, which would be more appropriate if the outcome was unexpectedly positive.

Charles was preparing for the harvest season and was aware of the potential challenges, including pest infestation and drought. He felt that pest infestation was a manageable problem with appropriate pest control measures, while drought would be dangerous. When he discovers that the crop is infested with pests, he is likely to feel relieved because it's a situation he anticipated and feels prepared to handle, rather than devastated or surprised. The expression in the image, although we cannot see the face, does not suggest extreme emotions such as devastation or surprise, which might be accompanied by more dramatic body language. The person's posture appears relatively neutral, which could indicate a sense of resignation or relief. Since Charles anticipated the pest problem and had measures in place to deal with it, relief is a more fitting interpretation of his feelings than resignation.

Rachel expected the city council to have concerns and questions about her bridge design. She considered questions about structural integrity to be safe because it would allow her to improve the design and ensure public safety. Since the city council did express concerns about the structural integrity and requested modifications, Rachel's expectation was met in a way that she deemed safe. Therefore, she would not feel devastated or surprised, as those emotions would likely be associated with an unexpected or negative outcome. Resignation typically implies a sense of giving up or acceptance without joy, which does not align with the context of Rachel's expectations being met positively. Relief is the emotion that best fits the situation, as Rachel's concerns about cost-effectiveness leading to cancellation or delay were not realized, and she can now focus on improving the design for safety.

A:b. relieved.
