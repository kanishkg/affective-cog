## Analyzing Zara's Potential Feelings:

**Given the context, let's evaluate each option:**

* **a. devastated:** This is a strong possibility. Zara anticipated this outcome to be "dangerous" and feared the judges' perception of her skill. Facing this criticism would likely leave her feeling devastated.
* **b. resigned:** Resignation implies acceptance of a negative but inevitable outcome. While Zara considered the possibility of failure, there's no indication she anticipated or accepted it as inevitable. 
* **c. relieved:** The situation offers no reason for Zara to feel relieved. The judges' criticism aligns with her fear, making relief an unlikely emotion. 
* **d. surprised:** Zara clearly considered the possibility of the dessert being too sweet and the negative consequences. Therefore, surprise wouldn't be an accurate emotion.
