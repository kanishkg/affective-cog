Sarah expected the weather to be pleasant during her hike, which implies that she did not anticipate adverse weather conditions. The sudden fog and reduced visibility are contrary to her expectations. Since she also thought that fog could be dangerous due to the risk of losing the trail and getting injured, the sudden appearance of fog would likely cause her to feel a negative emotion. Being relieved (a) is inconsistent with her concerns about fog. Being resigned (b) suggests acceptance of an inevitable situation, which might not be her immediate reaction to an unexpected change. Being surprised (c) fits the scenario because the fog was not what she expected. Being devastated (d) might be too strong a word for the situation unless the text indicated that the fog had caused a significant negative impact beyond just reduced visibility.

A:c. surprised.

- Julian is confident his pitch covers everything, so he does not expect any challenges or questions.
- Julian believes that criticism about the product's market fit would be safe and provide clear feedback.
- Julian thinks that questions about long-term viability would be dangerous as it could lead to weak investment support.
- The investors question the long-term viability of the product, which is the scenario Julian thought would be dangerous.

Given that Julian was not expecting challenges and thought that questions about long-term viability would be dangerous, it is unlikely that he feels relieved (a) or surprised (b), as he was confident in his pitch. He also does not expect any challenges, so surprise is less likely. Devastated (c) might be too strong a word, but it aligns with the idea that he would find such questions dangerous. Resigned (d) would imply that he has given up, which is not indicated by the information provided. The best guess, considering Julian's thoughts on the matter, is that he would be negatively affected by the investors' questions about long-term viability.

A:c. devastated.

- Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, which indicates he did not anticipate a negative outcome.
- The mixture became volatile and caused a small explosion, which is contrary to his expectations.
- Ben thought that if an explosion occurred, it would be dangerous and could damage the lab and his equipment, which suggests that an explosion was a concern for him.
- Given that an explosion did occur, it is likely that Ben would experience a negative emotion due to the unexpected and undesirable outcome.
- The options provided are different emotions that one might feel in such a situation. "Devastated" might be too strong a word if the explosion was small and Ben is safe. "Surprised" fits the scenario because the explosion was not expected. "Resigned" implies acceptance of an inevitable outcome, which does not align with Ben's initial expectations. "Relieved" would not be appropriate since the explosion actually happened and was not just a potential risk.

A: b. surprised. Ben would likely be surprised because the explosion was not what he expected from the experiment.

Helen expects the debate to go smoothly, which means she is optimistic about the outcome. She considers getting grilled by the moderator as safe, indicating she is confident in her ability to handle tough questions. However, she thinks that if her opponent launches a personal attack, it would be dangerous because it could harm her reputation and distract from her policy proposals. Since her opponent does launch a personal attack, Helen would likely feel negatively about this turn of events. The options provided are "devastated," "relieved," "resigned," and "surprised." "Relieved" would not fit the situation because a personal attack is what she feared. "Resigned" might imply that she was expecting it and is accepting it without much emotion, which doesn't quite fit the scenario described. "Surprised" could be a possibility if she wasn't expecting a personal attack, but the story doesn't indicate that she was surprised, just that she thought it would be dangerous. "Devastated" seems like a strong negative emotion that could result from something she feared would be damaging. Therefore, "devastated" seems like the most fitting option given the context.

A:a. devastated.

Penelope was preparing for her concert and expected it to go smoothly, which implies she did not anticipate any problems. She had planned for a guitar string break by having a backup guitar, showing she considered some potential issues and prepared for them. However, she thought that if the sound system malfunctions, it would be dangerous and could ruin the concert. Since the sound system did indeed malfunction, this is an issue she feared and expected to have a significant negative impact. Therefore, her reaction to this unexpected and unwanted event would likely be negative.

A:d. devastated.

Xavier is preparing for a high-end dinner service and expects it to go smoothly. He has considered the potential issues that could arise, such as spilling a drink or serving the wrong dish. He believes that spilling a drink is a minor issue that can be quickly resolved, but serving the wrong dish could be dangerous due to possible allergic reactions or offending the guest. Given that he has served the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which is something he specifically wanted to avoid, it is likely that Xavier would feel negatively about this mistake. The options are resigned (accepting of an undesirable situation), relieved (no longer feeling distressed or anxious), surprised (unexpectedly taken aback), or devastated (overwhelmed by grief or disappointment). Since serving the wrong dish is a serious error in his view, he would not feel relieved. He might be surprised if he did not expect the kitchen to make a mistake, but given the gravity of the situation, a stronger emotional response is likely. Devastated seems to be the most fitting option, as it implies a strong negative reaction to a significant mistake.

A:d. devastated.

Zara is passionate and expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received, which indicates she has high hopes for her creation. She considers the dessert failing to set as a safe scenario because she can explain the concept, suggesting she believes in her creativity. However, she views the dessert being too sweet as dangerous because it could reflect poorly on her skills. Since the judges criticize her dessert for being too sweet, which is the scenario she feared, it is likely that she feels negatively about this outcome. Being passionate and having high expectations, the criticism would likely be a significant disappointment to her.

A:d. devastated.

- Zachary expects the fashion show to go smoothly, which means he is hopeful for a positive outcome.
- He considers a model tripping to be a minor issue, something that is safe and can be quickly resolved.
- However, he believes that if his collection receives mixed reviews, it would be dangerous for his reputation and future opportunities.
- The story states that Zachary's collection receives mixed reviews from the fashion critics.
- Given that Zachary thought mixed reviews would be dangerous, it is likely that he feels negatively about this outcome.

Charles was preparing for the harvest season and expected it to go smoothly. He had considered the possibility of pests and had a plan for that, but he thought that drought would be dangerous as it could lead to significant loss. Since the story mentions that unusual weather patterns cause a drought, it is likely that Charles would feel negatively about this development. Being resigned would imply that he has accepted the situation without resistance, which is possible but doesn't necessarily reflect the concern he had about drought. Being relieved doesn't fit the context since the drought is a negative event for him. Being surprised might be a reaction if he didn't expect the drought, but the story doesn't emphasize his surprise; it emphasizes his concern about the danger of drought. Being devastated would be a strong negative reaction that aligns with his fear of the significant loss that drought could cause.

A:d. devastated.

Rachel expects the city council to approve her design without any issues, which implies she is confident about her design. She considers questioning the structural integrity as safe because it would allow for improvements, but she sees questioning the cost-effectiveness as dangerous because it could lead to cancellation or delays. Since the council questions the cost-effectiveness, which Rachel thought would be dangerous, it is likely that she feels negatively about this outcome. The options provided are "devastated," "surprised," "relieved," and "resigned." "Relieved" is unlikely because that would imply a positive outcome, which is not the case here. "Resigned" might be a possibility if she were accepting the outcome without further resistance, but there's no indication of her giving up. "Surprised" could be a possibility if she did not expect this outcome at all, but since she had considered it as a dangerous outcome, it's less likely. "Devastated" seems the most fitting, as it implies a strong negative reaction to an undesirable outcome, which is consistent with her view of questioning the cost-effectiveness as dangerous.

A:a. devastated.
