1. The story does not mention what Sarah thought about her safety if she encountered snowfall or fog. So we cannot answer this question.
However, we can make an educated guess based on the options provided.
2. Option a says that Sarah thought it would be dangerous if she encountered snowfall and could safely navigate if she encountered fog. This is unlikely, because snowfall is more dangerous than fog.
3. Option b says that Sarah thought it would be dangerous if she encountered fog and could safely navigate if she encountered snowfall. This is more likely, because fog is less dangerous than snowfall.
Therefore, my best guess is that Sarah thought it would be dangerous if she encountered fog and could safely navigate if she encountered snowfall.
A: b. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered fog and could safely navigate if she encountered snowfall.

1. The story does not mention anything about Zara's expectation of her dessert's safety if it failed to set or if it was criticized for being too sweet. So, we cannot provide an answer from the given context.

However, as per general food safety guidelines, a dessert that fails to set properly may pose a safety risk due to potential bacterial growth. On the other hand, a dessert that is criticized for being too sweet does not necessarily pose a safety risk.

Given that we have to choose one of the options, I would choose **a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.**

A:a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.
