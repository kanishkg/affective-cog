## Analyzing Julian's Situation:

Julian's confidence suggests he believed his pitch was comprehensive and would be well-received. The investors' criticism of the market fit indicates a significant flaw in Julian's plan, which he did not anticipate. 

## Answering the Question:

**Q: Julian feels devastated. What did Julian think about the safety of his pitch if the investors criticized the product's market fit or questioned long-term viability?**

**A: b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors questioned long-term viability and safe if they criticized the product's market fit.** 

**Explanation:**

Julian's devastation implies he considered the investors' feedback a threat to his pitch's success. Since he was unprepared for criticisms regarding market fit, it's logical to conclude he perceived that aspect as "safe" and didn't anticipate issues there. Consequently, the "dangerous" aspect, from his perspective, would be the questioning of long-term viability, as this suggests a fundamental flaw he hadn't considered.
