- Ben is conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound 
- He expects the experiment to go smoothly without any issues
- If the mixture causes a small, contained explosion, Ben thinks it would be safe
- If the mixture produces a toxic gas, Ben thinks it would be dangerous and could harm people
- The question asks what happened - if the mixture produced a toxic gas or caused an explosion
- It says Ben feels devastated by the outcome
- Since a small contained explosion would not have devastated Ben, the best guess is that the mixture produced a toxic gas that could harm people

Penelope was preparing for her first live concert after months of practice. She expected things to go smoothly. She thought a sound system malfunction would be safe to fix, but a broken guitar string would be dangerous and make her lose confidence on stage.

Rachel is an engineer who designed a new bridge for a busy city intersection. She expects the city council to approve her design without issues. If they question the cost-effectiveness, Rachel thinks it would be safe as it could optimize resources and lead to a better solution. If they question the structural integrity, Rachel feels it would be dangerous and damage her reputation as a reliable engineer.  

After Rachel presented her design, she felt devastated. This suggests the city council likely questioned the structural integrity rather than just the cost-effectiveness. If they had only questioned the cost, Rachel expected that would be safe in terms of her reputation.

A: a. Questioned the structural integrity
