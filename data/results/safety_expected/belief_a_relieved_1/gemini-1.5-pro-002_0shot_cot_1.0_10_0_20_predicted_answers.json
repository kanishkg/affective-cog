She specifically considered two scenarios: questions about cost-effectiveness and questions about structural integrity. She felt that questions about cost-effectiveness would be safe, while questions about structural integrity would be dangerous.  The council questioned the cost-effectiveness, which was the safer scenario Rachel had anticipated. Since she had already thought about this possibility, it is likely she expected some concerns.  The fact that she's relieved implies she was worried about the alternative (questions about structural integrity).\n\nA:a. Yes\n",
