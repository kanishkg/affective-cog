        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nHelen anticipated being grilled by the moderator and thought it would be a safe situation. However, when it happened, she struggled to respond effectively. This suggests she did not perform as well as she hoped and is likely feeling negatively.  While she might be surprised that it was harder than she anticipated, the fact that she struggled suggests a stronger negative emotion than surprise.  \"Devastated\" is perhaps too strong, but \"resigned\" implies acceptance, which doesn't fit the context.  \"Relieved\" is clearly wrong. Therefore, \"surprised\" is less likely than \"devastated\".\n\nA:d. devastated\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nXavier expected potential issues. He considered spilling a drink a safe mishap, while serving the wrong dish would be dangerous.  He did, in fact, spill a drink.  Since he anticipated this and considered it safe, he's unlikely to be devastated. He might be surprised it happened, but since he predicted it, surprised isn't the best fit.  Resigned implies acceptance of a negative outcome, but he believes this is easily fixed.  Therefore, relieved is the most likely emotion.\n\nA:a. relieved\n"
