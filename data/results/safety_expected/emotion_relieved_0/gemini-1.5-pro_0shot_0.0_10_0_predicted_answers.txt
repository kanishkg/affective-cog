## Analyzing the Example:

The provided example gives a scenario where Ben, despite anticipating potential risks, encounters a toxic gas situation during his experiment.  Let's break down the question and answer:

* **Question:** How does Ben feel?
* **Options:**
    * a. surprised 
    * b. resigned
    * c. relieved
    * d. devastated 
* **Correct Answer:**  A:c. relieved. 

**Explanation:**  Although Ben had to evacuate due to the toxic gas, he had already considered this possibility and felt prepared to handle it. This suggests he would likely feel **relieved** that the outcome wasn't worse (like an explosion). 

A: d. devastated. <br>
Helen is likely devastated as she struggled to respond effectively when grilled by the moderator, which was a scenario she had anticipated and prepared for. 

A:d. surprised. Penelope expected there might be technical issues, but she is still surprised when her guitar string breaks. 

## Analyzing Xavier's Feelings

Given the context, let's analyze Xavier's possible feelings after spilling the drink:

*   **a. surprised:** This is possible, as accidents can be unexpected. However, considering he anticipated potential issues, surprise might not be the dominant emotion.
*   **b. resigned:** This suggests acceptance of a negative but inevitable situation. While the accident is negative,  Xavier's proactive preparation suggests he wouldn't simply resign himself to the situation. 
*   **c. devastated:** This implies a feeling of extreme sadness or despair. While spilling a drink on a guest is a mishap, it wouldn't necessarily lead to devastation, especially considering his prior assessment of the situation.
*   **d. relieved:** This option seems unlikely, as spilling a drink doesn't resolve any anticipated problems or anxieties. 

Therefore, the most likely answer is: **A: a. surprised.** While Xavier expected potential issues, the actual occurrence of the accident would still likely catch him off guard, leading to surprise. 

A: d. devastated. <br>
