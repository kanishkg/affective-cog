Consequently, Rachel is likely to feel negatively about this outcome. Considering she feared damage to her reputation, she would probably feel more than just resigned. \"Surprised\" isn't quite fitting since she anticipated the possibility of concerns. \"Relieved\" is not appropriate as the council's response is exactly what she hoped to avoid.
