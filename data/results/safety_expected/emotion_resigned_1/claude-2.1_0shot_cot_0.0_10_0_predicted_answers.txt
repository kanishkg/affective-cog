Sarah is hiking alone on a challenging mountain trail. She knows there may be bad weather, but thinks she can handle fog with her compass. However, she knows snowfall could strand her and cause hypothermia. When she reaches the summit, she encounters snowfall. This is the dangerous situation she was worried about.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this story and question:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Julian is an entrepreneur pitching his startup to investors
- He expects investors to challenge parts of his pitch
- If they question long-term viability, Julian thinks that's a good sign of future partnership 
- If they criticize market fit, Julian thinks that could collapse the pitch and miss the opportunity
- The investors sharply criticize the market fit and demand substantial changes

So the investors criticized the part of the pitch that Julian thought could lead to a missed opportunity. He likely feels devastated that his pitch seems to be collapsing.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ben is conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound for medical applications
- He expects there may be unexpected outcomes from the experiment
- If there was a small, contained explosion, Ben thought it would be safe due to his safety measures
- If the mixture produced a toxic gas, Ben knew that could be dangerous and harm people
- The actual outcome was that the mixture did produce a toxic gas 
- Ben had to evacuate the lab due to the toxic gas
- Since the toxic gas outcome is what Ben was worried could be dangerous, he likely feels concerned that people may have been harmed

A: c. relieved

I chose relieved as the best option. Even though the toxic gas outcome is what Ben was worried about, the passage says he had to evacuate the lab. This likely means no one was harmed. With no injuries, Ben would feel relieved that the situation did not turn out worse than just having to evacuate.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Helen is a politician preparing for a crucial mayoral debate against her opponent
- She expects there may be some challenging moments in the debate
- She thinks a personal attack from her opponent would be safe as it could backfire on them
- She thinks getting grilled by the moderator would be dangerous as it could hurt her credibility 
- During the debate, Helen gets grilled by the moderator and struggles to respond effectively

A: c. surprised

I chose surprised because while Helen expected the debate may have some challenging moments, she specifically thought that getting grilled by the moderator would be dangerous for her. So when that happened and she struggled to respond, she likely felt surprised at both being put in that tough situation and not being as prepared for it as she had hoped.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Penelope is a talented musician preparing for her first live concert
- She expects some technical issues, but thinks sound system malfunctions would be safe to fix
- She thinks a broken guitar string would be dangerous and make her lose confidence on stage
- During the show, her guitar string breaks, causing her to pause
- This would likely make Penelope feel devastated as she was worried about this specific issue causing her to lose confidence

A: d. devastated
 Thought: Let's think step by step:
Xavier is a waiter serving an influential group of guests at a high-end restaurant. He expects there may be some issues during dinner service. Xavier thinks serving the wrong dish would be safe since he can quickly replace it, while spilling a drink could be dangerous by damaging clothing and making a bad impression. Xavier carefully prepares for serving. However, he accidentally spills a drink on a guest.

Xavier likely feels devastated. He tried to prepare carefully to avoid any major issues. Spilling the drink is one of the dangerous situations he specifically wanted to avoid, since it could damage clothing and impressions. Even though replacing a wrong dish seemed safe, a spill directly on a guest is his worst-case scenario come true. So Xavier likely feels devastated that this happened despite his efforts.

A: c. devastated

Let's think step-by-step:
1) Zara is participating in a prestigious baking competition where she needs to create a new and innovative dessert. 
2) She expects there might be some issues - if it's too sweet she can defend it as a bold move, but if it fails to set that would be seen as a technical failure and could cost her the competition.
3) Her dessert ended up failing to set properly resulting in a runny and unappealing presentation. 
4) Since Zara thought failing to set would be dangerous and could cost her the competition, she is likely devastated that this happened.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question:

Thought: Let's think step-by-step:
- Zachary is a talented designer showcasing his latest collection at a fashion show
- He expects there might be some minor issues during the show
- If his collection gets mixed reviews, he thinks that would be safe and could lead to improvements 
- If a model trips, he thinks that would be dangerous as it could overshadow his designs
- During the show, one of the models trips, causing a small disruption
- Since Zachary was expecting minor issues and already considered a model tripping to be dangerous, he is likely not surprised
- A model tripping is not ideal, but since it caused only a small disruption, he may feel relieved rather than devastated

A: b. surprised

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Charles is a farmer preparing for harvest by planting a new crop variety 
- He expects some challenges during the growing season
- He thinks drought would be safe to manage with water saving and irrigation
- He thinks pests would be dangerous as they could spread and be hard to control
- Charles follows recommended practices in sowing and cultivating the crops
- He discovers the crops are infested with pests

A: c. devastated

I chose devastated as my answer. Since Charles thought a pest infestation would be dangerous and hard to control, he likely feels devastated to discover his crops are infested. This matches his expectations that a pest problem would be difficult to manage.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Rachel is an engineer presenting a new bridge design to the city council
- She expects the council to have concerns and questions about the design
- If they question cost-effectiveness, Rachel thinks that would be safe and helpful
- If they question structural integrity, Rachel thinks that would be dangerous to her reputation
- The city council expressed concerns about the structural integrity and requested modifications
- This matches what Rachel thought would be dangerous to her reputation

A: b. devastated

Rachel likely feels devastated that the city council questioned the structural integrity of her design, since Rachel thought that would damage her reputation as a reliable engineer. Even though modifications were requested and not an outright rejection, questioning structural integrity attacks her competency which could be devastating.
