## Analyzing Xavier's Situation: 

Based on the provided information, Xavier anticipated a smooth service and considered the potential consequences of mistakes. He seemed more concerned about spilling a drink on a guest than serving the wrong dish.

## Answering the Question:

**Q: Xavier feels surprised. Did Xavier spill a drink on a guest or serve the wrong dish to a guest?**

## Analyzing Zara's Situation: 

We know Zara is worried about two potential outcomes:

*   **Criticism for excessive sweetness:**  She considers this a **safe** scenario, believing she can justify her bold flavor choice.
*   **Failure to set:** This is a **dangerous** scenario for her, fearing it would be perceived as a technical error and jeopardize her chances in the competition.

## Understanding "Surprise":

The question asks about Zara feeling **surprised**. We need to consider which scenario would be more unexpected for her:

*   **Criticism for sweetness:** As she anticipated this possibility and planned her defense, it's less likely to surprise her.
*   **Failure to set:** Since she considers this a dangerous and undesirable outcome, it's more likely to catch her off guard and cause surprise.
