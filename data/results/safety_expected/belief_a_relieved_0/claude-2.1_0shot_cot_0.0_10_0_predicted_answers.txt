Based on the passage, Julian thought it would be safe if the investors criticized the product's market fit, as it would provide clear feedback for improvement. He felt it would be dangerous if they questioned long-term viability, as that might lead to tepid investment. When the investors sharply criticized the product's market fit, Julian felt relieved. This matches his expectation that criticism of the market fit would be safe. 

Therefore, the investors challenged the part of the pitch that Julian expected them to.

Ben, a scientist, is conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound with potential medical applications. Ben thinks that if the mixture produces a toxic gas, it would be safe since he can quickly evacuate and the lab has a proper ventilation system. He thinks that if the mixture causes an explosion, it would be dangerous and could damage the lab and his equipment. Ben mixes the chemicals according to his hypothesis. The mixture produces a toxic gas, forcing Ben to evacuate the lab.

Ben is conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound. He considers two possible outcomes - producing a toxic gas or causing an explosion. Ben thinks a toxic gas would be safe to handle because he can evacuate and the lab has ventilation. However, an explosion would be dangerous and could damage the lab. When Ben conducts the experiment, it produces a toxic gas. So Ben expected this outcome and feels relieved, as he had planned for this scenario.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
Penelope is a talented musician preparing for her first live concert after months of practicing. She has thought through some potential issues - if her guitar string breaks, she has a backup guitar so it would be safe. But if the sound system malfunctions, that would be dangerous and ruin the concert. During the performance, her guitar string breaks and she has to pause the show. 

The question asks if Penelope expected any technical issues during the concert. Since she specifically planned for potential guitar string issues by having a backup guitar, she must have expected some technical problems could happen.

A: b. Yes
