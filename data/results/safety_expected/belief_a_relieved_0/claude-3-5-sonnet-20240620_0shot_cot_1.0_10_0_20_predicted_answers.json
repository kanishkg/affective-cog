Zara had considered two potential scenarios:\n   a. If her dessert fails to set, she thought it would be safe because she could explain the innovative concept.\n   b. If the judges find her dessert too sweet, she thought it would be dangerous as it could be seen as a lack of skill.\n4. In the actual outcome, Zara's dessert failed to set properly.\n5. The question states that Zara feels relieved after this outcome.\n6. Zara's feeling of relief aligns with her initial thought that a failure to set would be a \"safe\" issue.\n7.
