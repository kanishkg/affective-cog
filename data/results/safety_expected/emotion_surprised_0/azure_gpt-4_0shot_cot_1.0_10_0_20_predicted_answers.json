Now, when she encounters snowfall at the summit, it aligns with her previous thoughts of it being a positive outcome that could enhance her hiking experience. There's no information suggesting that she's resigned, relieved, or devastated by this encounter, and given that she considered the possibility of snow beforehand, she may not be completely surprised either. However, the most fitting response based on her previous thoughts on snowfall would be that she finds the snowfall to be a positive aspect of her hike, so we can best guess that her reaction would be closer to being surprised in a pleasant way than the other options provided.\n\nA:d. surprised",

This indicates that she finds snowfall to be a positive possibility, even if it was not what she initially expected. Therefore, she would likely not feel resigned, devastated, or overly surprised as she considered snowfall to be a safe and aesthetically pleasing outcome.

However, we know that Sarah thinks encountering snowfall would be safe and make her hike more picturesque, suggesting that she would have a positive view of snowfall despite it not being what she initially expected. Since Sarah has a positive anticipation of snowfall, encountering it would likely not make her feel devastated, resigned, or surprised.
