        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nJulian expected no challenges or questions. He also thought criticism of the product's market fit would be \"safe\".  He is therefore likely surprised by the criticism, but not devastated.  He wouldn't be relieved either, as he didn't anticipate this specific criticism. Resigned implies acceptance and he hasn't reached that stage yet.\n\nA:b. surprised\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nHelen expected the debate to go smoothly. She anticipated either getting grilled by the moderator or facing a personal attack from her opponent. She believed that getting grilled would be safe, while a personal attack would be dangerous. However, she ended up getting grilled by the moderator and struggled to respond effectively. This was a situation she thought she was prepared for, but her performance fell short of her expectations. This would likely lead to feelings of surprise and disappointment.\n\nA:b. surprised\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nPenelope expected the concert to go smoothly. She had a backup plan for a broken string, so she shouldn't be devastated.  She also shouldn't be relieved because the string breaking is still a disruption. Resigned implies acceptance of a negative outcome, but she has a backup guitar, so she wouldn't feel resigned.  Since she expected things to go smoothly, a broken string would be unexpected.\n\nA:b. surprised\n"

She had a backup plan to explain her concept and hoped the judges would appreciate her creativity.  Therefore, she is likely relieved that the worse-case scenario (in her mind) happened, rather than it being too sweet.\n\nA:c. relieved\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nCharles expected a smooth growing season. He also thought that a pest infestation could be handled with pest control measures, so he wouldn't be devastated. He wouldn't be relieved either, as it's still an issue to deal with.  He might be surprised since he expected no issues, but he also has a plan for it. Resigned implies acceptance of a negative outcome, but Charles believes he can control the pests. So, surprised seems like the most appropriate emotion.\n\nA:c. surprised\n"

However, she also mentioned that if the council questioned the structural integrity, it would be *safe* because it allows her to improve the design. This implies a sense of relief rather than devastation or resignation.\n\nA:d. relieved\n"
