Sarah expected the weather to be pleasant during her hike.
Sarah thought that encountering snowfall would be safe and make her hike more picturesque.
Since Sarah encounters snowfall, which aligns with her positive expectations, she is likely to feel good about it.
The options provided are "devastated," "relieved," "resigned," and "surprised." Given her positive expectations about snowfall, "devastated" is unlikely. "Relieved" could be a possibility if she was worried about encountering fog instead, but there's no indication that she was expecting fog over snow. "Resigned" suggests acceptance of an unwanted situation, which doesn't fit her positive view of snowfall. "Surprised" could be a possibility if the snowfall was unexpected, but since she considered it in her expectations, it's less likely to be the correct answer.

A:d. surprised.

- Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, so the production of toxic gas was not part of his positive expectations.
- However, Ben had considered the possibility of a toxic gas being produced and had planned for it by relying on the lab's ventilation system and the ability to evacuate quickly.
- Since Ben had prepared for this scenario, he might not be devastated, as he had a plan in place.
- He might not be surprised either, as he had considered the possibility of a toxic gas.
- He is unlikely to feel relieved, as the production of toxic gas is still a negative outcome.
- Resigned might be the closest to his feelings, as he had considered the possibility and was prepared to evacuate, indicating a level of acceptance of the risks involved.

A:c. resigned.

Helen is preparing for a crucial debate, so she is likely taking it seriously and understands the importance of performing well.
Helen expects the debate to go smoothly, which indicates she is initially confident.
Helen believes that being grilled by the moderator would be safe and show her ability to handle tough questions, so she is not afraid of tough questions.
However, Helen gets grilled by the moderator and struggles to respond effectively, which means the situation did not go as she had anticipated or prepared for.
Given that Helen struggled, it is unlikely she feels relieved or surprised, as struggling is not a positive outcome and she had considered the possibility of tough questions.
Devastation or resignation could be possible feelings. Devastation would imply that she feels overwhelmed by the negative outcome, while resignation would imply that she has accepted the struggle without much hope of it improving.
Since Helen was preparing and had expectations of handling tough questions well, the struggle would likely be a significant setback, making devastation a more fitting response than resignation.

A:b. devastated.

She has considered the possibility of a guitar string breaking and has a backup guitar ready, which suggests she would not be overly troubled by this incident. Since she has planned for this specific issue, it is unlikely that she would feel devastated or surprised. She might be slightly resigned because it's a hiccup in her performance, but given that she has a backup plan, she is more likely to feel relieved that she can quickly recover and continue with her concert.

Xavier is a waiter at a high-end restaurant, which implies that he is likely experienced and takes his job seriously, especially when serving influential guests.
Xavier expects the dinner service to go smoothly, which suggests that he is confident in his abilities and has likely prepared for the event.
Xavier thinks that spilling a drink would be safe since he can quickly apologize and clean up, indicating that he does not see it as a major issue.
Xavier accidentally spills a drink on one of the guests, which is something he considered a minor issue that can be handled with an apology and quick action.

Given these points, Xavier is unlikely to feel devastated or resigned, as he had already considered the possibility of spilling a drink and had a plan to address it. He might be surprised because accidents are unexpected, but he would not be relieved, as spilling a drink is not a positive outcome. Therefore, the most likely emotion he would feel is surprise because the spill was accidental and not part of the plan.

A:a. surprised.

Zara is passionate about baking and is participating in a prestigious competition, so her expectations for her dessert are high. She expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received. However, she has also thought about potential failures and their consequences. Zara believes that if her dessert fails to set, it would be safe because she can explain the innovative concept, which might be appreciated by the judges. This indicates that she has considered this possibility and is somewhat prepared for it. Therefore, while she might be disappointed, she is unlikely to be devastated because she has a contingency plan in mind. She also won't be surprised because she has already considered the possibility of the dessert not setting. She might feel resigned because she has anticipated this outcome and is prepared to explain her concept to the judges. She is unlikely to feel relieved because her dessert did not turn out as she intended, and it's a competition where presentation matters.

Zachary expects the fashion show to go smoothly, but he also thinks that if a model trips, it would be safe and can be quickly resolved. This indicates that he is prepared for such an incident and does not consider it a significant problem. Since the scenario mentions that a model does trip, but Zachary had already considered this possibility and did not see it as a major issue, he is unlikely to feel devastated or surprised. He might be slightly resigned because it's an incident he hoped wouldn't happen but was prepared for. However, since he thought it could be quickly resolved and is a common occurrence, he might also feel relieved that it wasn't a more serious issue like his collection receiving mixed reviews, which he considered dangerous.

Charles expected the growing season to go smoothly, which implies he was optimistic about not encountering any issues. However, he also had a contingency plan for pests, indicating he was aware of the possibility and prepared to deal with it. Since he had considered the possibility of pests and planned for pest control measures, he would not be surprised or devastated by the infestation. He would likely not feel relieved either, as dealing with pests is not a positive event, even if he is prepared. The most fitting emotion would be resigned, as he was prepared for this scenario and is likely to accept it as a part of farming that needs to be addressed.

Rachel expects the city council to approve her design without any issues, which means she is confident in her work. She also thinks that if the council questions the structural integrity, it would be safe since it would allow her to improve the design and ensure public safety. This indicates that she sees questioning the structural integrity as an opportunity to make the bridge better, not as a setback. Therefore, she is likely to feel positive about the opportunity to improve the design rather than negative emotions such as being devastated or surprised. Since she anticipated approval without issues, she might not feel resigned, as that would imply she was expecting a negative outcome. Given the context, the most fitting emotion would be relief because the council's concerns align with a scenario she considers safe.
