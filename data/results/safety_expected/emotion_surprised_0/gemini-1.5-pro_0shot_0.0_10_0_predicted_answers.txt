## Analyzing Xavier's Potential Feelings:

We need to consider Xavier's expectations and the situation's outcome to understand his feelings.

*   **Expectation:** He anticipated a smooth service without issues.
*   **Reality:** He spills a drink on a guest, directly contradicting his expectation.

Given these points, let's analyze the options:

*   **a. resigned:** This implies acceptance of a negative situation. While Xavier might eventually resign himself to the situation, his immediate feeling is likely more intense.
*   **b. surprised:** This is a plausible reaction as the spill is unexpected and contradicts his expectations.
*   **c. devastated:** This seems overly intense for a spilled drink, especially since Xavier believes it's a safe mistake. 
*   **d. relieved:** This doesn't fit the situation as there's no indication of prior stress or worry that would lead to relief.

Therefore, the most likely answer is: 

**A: b. surprised.**  <br>
