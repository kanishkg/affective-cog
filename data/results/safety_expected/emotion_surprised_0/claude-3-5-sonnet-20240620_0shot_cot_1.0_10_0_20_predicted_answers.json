        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Julian went into the pitch feeling very confident, not expecting any challenges.\n\n2. He had predetermined thoughts about potential investor reactions:\n   - Criticism of market fit: considered \"safe\" and helpful for improvement\n   - Questioning long-term viability: considered \"dangerous\" for investment\n\n3.
