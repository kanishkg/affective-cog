 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Julian was preparing to pitch his startup to investors
- He thought criticism about market fit would be safe as it would provide feedback to improve
- He thought questioning long-term viability would be dangerous as it could lead to weak investment
- The investors questioned the long-term viability
- Julian felt devastated by this
- Julian expected criticism about market fit, not long-term viability

A: a. No

Julian did not expect the investors to challenge the long-term viability of his product. He expected them to criticize the market fit instead. So when they questioned the long-term viability, it went against his expectations and he felt devastated.

From the story, we know that Zara was creating an innovative dessert for a baking competition. She thought that if her dessert failed to set, it would be safe since she could explain the concept and judges might appreciate the creativity.

When the judges criticized her dessert for being too sweet, this was one of the issues Zara thought could be dangerous for her chances. So Zara likely did expect potential issues with her innovative dessert being too sweet.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Rachel is an engineer working on a new bridge design for a busy city intersection
- She thinks questions about structural integrity would allow her to improve the design and ensure public safety
