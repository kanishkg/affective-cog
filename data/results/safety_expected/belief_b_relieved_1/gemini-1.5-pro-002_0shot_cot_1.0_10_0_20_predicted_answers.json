The passage says she \"expects that there might be some adverse weather events on the trail\".  She then experiences fog and we're told she is relieved.  This implies she felt prepared for fog and not relieved. Therefore, she likely thought fog was navigable, and snowfall was more dangerous.\n\nA:b.

If she believed fog was dangerous, she would have probably turned back or taken more precautions. The question is trickily worded - it asks about what she thinks *if* she encountered snowfall or fog. Since she seems prepared to encounter adverse weather, and she continues despite the fog, the more logical answer is that she feels safer in fog than in snowfall.\n\nA:b.
