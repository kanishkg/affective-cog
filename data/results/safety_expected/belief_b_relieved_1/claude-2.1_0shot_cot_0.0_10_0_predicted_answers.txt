Julian was preparing to pitch his startup to investors. He expected the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch. When the investors questioned the long-term viability of his product, Julian felt relieved.

Ben was conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound. He expected that there might be some unexpected outcomes. When the chemicals reacted and caused a small explosion, Ben felt relieved. This suggests that Ben had anticipated the possibility of an explosion or other dangerous outcome. Since the passage says he expected unexpected results, he likely thought both an explosion and toxic gas production would be dangerous possibilities.

A: b. Ben thought that it would be dangerous if the mixture produced a toxic gas and safe if it caused an explosion.

My reasoning is that since Ben felt relieved when there was just a small explosion, he must have anticipated that outcome as a dangerous possibility. But he still went ahead with the experiment anyway. Therefore, he must have expected both toxic gas and an explosion to be potentially dangerous outcomes. By feeling relieved at just an explosion, it suggests he saw that as the less risky of the two possibilities.

 <admin> Let's think through this step-by-step:

Thought: Penelope was preparing for her first live concert after months of practice. She expected there might be some technical issues during the concert. When the sound system malfunctioned, leading to poor audio quality, this was one of the issues she had anticipated. 

The passage does not provide any information about Penelope's thoughts on the safety of the concert if her guitar string broke. It also does not say she felt relieved when the sound system malfunctioned. So we cannot assume what she thought about the safety or her emotional reaction in that hypothetical situation.

The question asks what Penelope thought about the safety of the concert if either the guitar string broke or the sound system malfunctioned. Since the passage does not provide information to determine her specific thoughts on the safety for either situation, the best option is:

A: c. The passage does not provide enough information to determine what Penelope thought.

1) Zara is participating in a baking competition and creates an innovative dessert. 

2) The judges criticize Zara's dessert for being too sweet and overpowering. This means her dessert was safe to eat, just not enjoyable.

3) The passage states that Zara expected there might be "some issues" with her innovative dessert. This implies she thought it might fail to set properly or be overly sweet. 

4) If the dessert failed to set, it could be dangerous or unsafe to eat. However, just being too sweet would not make it unsafe, only less enjoyable.

Therefore:

Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set, and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.

A: a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.

Rachel presented her bridge design to the city council. The city council questioned the cost-effectiveness of her design and suggested exploring other options. They did not question the structural integrity or safety of the design. This means Rachel likely felt her design was structurally sound and safe. 

If the city council had questioned the structural integrity, Rachel would have felt her design was potentially unsafe. But they only questioned the cost-effectiveness. So Rachel likely felt relieved that the safety of her design was not questioned.

A: b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness
