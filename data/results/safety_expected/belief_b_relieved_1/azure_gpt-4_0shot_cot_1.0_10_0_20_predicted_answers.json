Zachary's relief is likely associated with the avoidance of the more severe or dangerous outcome he was concerned about.\n- If he was worried about the safety of the fashion show, a model tripping would typically be considered a safety concern rather than mixed reviews, which is more of a professional critique and not directly related to safety.\n\nA: b.

If she feels relieved when the city council questions the cost-effectiveness, this suggests that she was more concerned they might question the safety aspects of her design. Therefore, it is likely that Rachel thought her design was safe structurally, and her concern was that the council would question this, which they did not.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nIf Rachel feels relieved after the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness of her design, it implies that she was more concerned about them questioning another aspect of her design. Since structural integrity is a critical aspect of a bridge and questioning it could imply potential safety issues, it's likely that Rachel was more worried about questions regarding safety (structural integrity) than cost. Thus, if the council had questioned the structural integrity, it could indicate that they thought her design was unsafe, which would be a much more severe issue than cost-effectiveness.

However, since she feels relieved when the city council questions the cost-effectiveness rather than the structural integrity, it suggests that she may have been more concerned about potential safety questions. Engineers often prioritize safety over cost since it's a critical aspect of their professional ethics and responsibilities. Cost can often be negotiated or optimized, but compromising on safety is usually not acceptable. Since she is relieved, we can infer that she was confident in the safety (structural integrity) of her design and prepared to discuss or defend the cost.\nA:a.

If she thought the structural integrity would be seen as insufficient and dangerous, she likely would not have felt relieved when the council brought up concerns about cost.
