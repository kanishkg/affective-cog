Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Sarah is a solo hiker navigating a challenging mountain trail 
- She expects there may be adverse weather events like snowfall or fog
- She thinks snowfall would be safe and make the hike more picturesque
- But fog could be dangerous since she could lose the trail or get injured
- While hiking, Sarah suddenly experiences fog with reduced visibility
- This is the adverse event Sarah thought could be dangerous
- So she likely feels concerned about losing the trail or getting injured

A: c. surprised

I chose surprised as Sarah did not expect to encounter fog on her hike. Even though she considered it a possibility, when it suddenly occurred she was likely surprised at that moment before feeling concerned about the danger.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ben is a scientist conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound
- He expects there may be some unexpected outcomes from the experiment
- If it produces toxic gas, he thinks it would be safe because he can evacuate and the lab has ventilation
- If it causes an explosion, he thinks that would be dangerous and could damage the lab
- When he mixes the chemicals, it causes a small explosion
- Even though Ben expected unexpected outcomes, a small explosion likely exceeds what he was anticipating
- He is probably feeling surprised and maybe a bit devastated that his experiment caused damage

A: c. surprised

I chose surprised as the best answer because even though Ben was anticipating unexpected outcomes, a small explosion probably exceeds what he was expecting, so he is likely feeling surprised at this dangerous outcome. He may also feel a bit devastated that his experiment caused damage, but surprised matches most closely.
