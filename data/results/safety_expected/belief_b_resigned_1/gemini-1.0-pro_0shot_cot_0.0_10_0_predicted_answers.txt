- The paragraph never mentions Sarah's thoughts about her safety.

Since there's no information about Sarah's thoughts on her safety, we cannot choose either option.

**However, we can make an educated guess based on common sense.**

It's more likely that Sarah would think it would be dangerous to encounter snowfall than fog. Snowfall can make trails slippery and difficult to navigate, and can also lead to hypothermia if not properly prepared for. Fog, on the other hand, can make it difficult to see, but it's less likely to cause serious injury or death.

Therefore, the best guess is:

A: a. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered snowfall and could safely navigate if she encountered fog.

We know that Zachary felt resigned about the possibility of a model tripping during the show, so he expected that it might happen.
Option (a) suggests that Zachary thought it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.
Option (b) suggests that Zachary thought it would be dangerous if his collection received mixed reviews and safe if a model tripped.
However, the paragraph does not mention anything about Zachary's opinion on the safety of his fashion show if his collection received mixed reviews.
Therefore, we cannot choose either option (a) or (b) with certainty.
However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that Zachary felt resigned about the possibility of a model tripping.
If Zachary was resigned to the possibility of a model tripping, it is more likely that he thought it was a minor risk that might happen, rather than a major danger that would ruin the show.
Therefore, it is more likely that Zachary thought it would be **safe** if a model tripped and **dangerous** if his collection received mixed reviews.
A: a. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.
