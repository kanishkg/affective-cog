A: a. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered snowfall and could safely navigate if she encountered fog. 

## Analyzing Julian's Situation: 

We don't have direct information about Julian's thoughts on the safety of his pitch in the given context. However, we can analyze his possible concerns based on the investors' reactions.

**Market Fit Criticism:** This critique directly challenges the core of Julian's business plan, suggesting his product might not meet the needs of the target market. This would be a significant concern for investors and likely a danger sign for the success of the venture.

**Long-Term Viability Questions:** While still a concern, questioning long-term viability might offer opportunities for Julian to address potential challenges and adapt his plan. It wouldn't necessarily negate the core idea or market fit. 

## Choosing the Best Answer:

Based on this analysis:

**A: b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors questioned long-term viability and safe if they criticized the product's market fit.** 
 
This option seems less likely because, as discussed, the market fit criticism poses a more immediate threat to the business plan's core assumptions. 

A: b. Ben thought that it would be dangerous if the mixture caused an explosion and safe if it produced a toxic gas. 
***
Explanation:
The passage states, "Ben expects that the experiment might have some unexpected outcomes." This implies Ben considered potential safety risks. The fact that the mixture produced a toxic gas suggests Ben anticipated the possibility of hazardous fumes as an "unexpected outcome." 

A: b. Helen thought that it would be dangerous if her opponent launched a personal attack and safe if she got grilled by the moderator. 
***
**Explanation:**

The passage indicates Helen anticipated "challenging moments" and practiced counterarguments, suggesting concern about attacks or difficult questions. Getting "grilled" by the moderator implies tough but fair questioning, which she prepared for. A "personal attack" from her opponent, however, suggests an unpredictable and potentially damaging situation she might not be prepared for. 

A: b. Penelope thought that it would be dangerous if the sound system malfunctioned and safe if her guitar string broke. 
*** 
The passage states, "Penelope expects that there might be some technical issues during the concert," implying she considered potential problems. The fact that she continues with the performance suggests she didn't perceive these issues as dangerous. However, a broken guitar string is a relatively minor issue compared to a sound system malfunction, which could potentially harm the audience with loud feedback or electrical problems. 

A: b. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest. 
***
Xavier's concern about serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions implies he considered it a more serious issue, potentially causing harm, compared to spilling a drink. 

A: a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet. 
***
From the context, it appears Zara is more concerned about the structural integrity of the dessert rather than the taste. A dessert failing to set could imply issues with ingredients or preparation, potentially leading to safety concerns, while criticism about sweetness is subjective and doesn't inherently pose a danger. 

A: b. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews. 

*** 

**Explanation:**

The passage states that Zachary anticipated "minor issues" during the fashion show. The example of a model tripping aligns with the concept of a minor issue that could disrupt the show's flow or presentation, making it a potential concern for Zachary. Receiving mixed reviews, while possibly disappointing, wouldn't pose a direct threat to the safety or smooth execution of the fashion show. 

A: a. Charles thought that it would be dangerous if his crop was infested with pests and safe if it was affected by drought. 
***
The passage states, "...Charles expects that there might be some challenges during the growing season." This implies Charles is concerned about potential threats to his crop. Later, when pests infest the crop, Charles feels resigned, suggesting he views pests as a danger to his crop. 

## Analyzing Rachel's Resignation: 

We need to understand why Rachel feels resigned after the city council's concerns to assess her thoughts on the design's safety.

**A: b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.**

**Explanation:**

*   **Resignation implies a negative outcome:** If Rachel felt her design was safe despite questions about structural integrity, she wouldn't be resigned. She would likely defend her design and provide evidence of its safety.
*   **Concerns about structural integrity directly relate to safety:** Questions about this aspect would naturally make Rachel feel the design is unsafe and lead to her resignation. 
*   **Cost-effectiveness is a separate issue:** While important, it doesn't directly imply the bridge is unsafe. Rachel might be disappointed or frustrated if the council questioned the cost, but it's less likely to cause resignation compared to safety concerns.
