*   He believes criticism regarding **market fit** is less concerning as it provides direction for improvement.

## Analyzing Penelope's Potential Devastation:

We know Penelope is worried about two potential issues: a broken guitar string and a sound system malfunction. She considers the sound system malfunction to be **dangerous** and potentially ruinous to the concert, while a broken string seems manageable with her backup guitar. 

**Therefore, if Penelope feels devastated, it's more likely due to the event she considers more impactful and negative.**

**A: b. Sound system malfunction.** 

A: a. Served the wrong dish. 

**Explanation:** The passage tells us that Xavier believes serving the wrong dish would be dangerous due to potential allergic reactions or offense caused. If he feels devastated, it's more likely he made the mistake he considered dangerous. 

## Analyzing Zara's Situation:

Zara's concern about her dessert failing to set being "safe" suggests she prioritizes innovation and concept over perfection.  Her fear of the dessert being "too sweet" being "dangerous" implies she's more worried about the judges questioning her skills as a baker. 

## Determining Devastation:

Since Zara values her baking skills and fears criticism about them, being judged for excessive sweetness would likely cause her more devastation than a dessert that didn't set. 

## Answer:
A: b. Criticized for being too sweet. Zara's greater fear of being seen as lacking skill due to excessive sweetness suggests this outcome would devastate her more. 

## Analyzing Zachary's Situation:

We know Zachary is worried about two potential events:

*   **Model tripping:** He considers this a **safe** situation.
*   **Mixed reviews:** He considers this a **dangerous** situation.

The question tells us Zachary feels **devastated**. Since he considers receiving mixed reviews as "dangerous" and likely to cause negative emotions, the answer should be the option reflecting that outcome. 

Therefore: 

**A: b. Collection received mixed reviews.**
