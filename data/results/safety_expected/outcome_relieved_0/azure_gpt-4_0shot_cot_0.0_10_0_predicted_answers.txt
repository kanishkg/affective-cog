Sarah feels relieved, which suggests that the conditions she encountered are not causing her stress or concern. According to her expectations, snowfall would be safe and make her hike more picturesque, which could lead to a feeling of relief. On the other hand, fog could be dangerous and cause her to lose the trail, which would likely not lead to a feeling of relief. Therefore, the condition that would make Sarah feel relieved is the one she perceives as safe and enjoyable.

A:b. Snowfall.

- Julian feels relieved after the pitch.
- Julian expected to feel safe if the investors criticized the product's market fit because it would provide clear feedback for improvement.
- Julian expected to feel it was dangerous if the investors questioned the long-term viability because it might lead to tepid investment without strong support.
- Feeling relieved likely means that the outcome was more positive or at least not negative in a way that would cause concern for Julian.
- Therefore, Julian's relief suggests that the investors did not question the aspect of his pitch that he thought would be dangerous (long-term viability).

A:a. Criticized the product's market fit.

- Ben feels relieved after mixing the chemicals.
- If the mixture had caused an explosion, Ben would likely not feel relieved because it would be dangerous and could damage the lab and his equipment.
- If the mixture had produced a toxic gas, Ben would still feel safe and potentially relieved because he can quickly evacuate and the lab has a proper ventilation system.
- Since Ben feels relieved, it is more likely that the outcome was not the dangerous one (explosion) but the one he felt prepared for (toxic gas).

A:b. Produced a toxic gas.

- Helen feels relieved, which suggests that the outcome was positive or at least not as negative as she feared.
- Helen thought getting grilled by the moderator would be safe and show her ability to handle tough questions.
- Helen thought a personal attack from her opponent would be dangerous and could damage her reputation.
- Feeling relieved likely means that the situation she feared did not occur, or the one she was prepared for happened.
- Since she was prepared for tough questions from the moderator and saw it as an opportunity, it's less likely that this would cause relief. Relief is more likely in the context of avoiding something negative.
- Therefore, if she feels relieved, it's more likely because she did not face the scenario she thought would be dangerous, which is the personal attack from her opponent.

A:a. Grilled by the moderator.

Penelope feels relieved, which suggests that the issue she encountered was not catastrophic for her performance.
Penelope had anticipated that a broken guitar string would be safe because she has a backup guitar, which implies she could quickly recover from such an incident.
On the other hand, Penelope thought that a sound system malfunction would be dangerous and could ruin the concert, which would not lead to a feeling of relief.
Since Penelope feels relieved, it is more likely that she experienced the issue she considered safe and for which she was prepared, rather than the one she thought could ruin the concert.

A:b. Broken guitar string.

Xavier feels relieved, which suggests that the situation he was worried about did not occur or was resolved without major issues. Since he thought spilling a drink would be safe and could be quickly apologized for and cleaned up, it would not be a significant problem and could lead to relief after handling it well. On the other hand, serving the wrong dish could cause an allergic reaction or offend the guest, which he considered dangerous. If he had served the wrong dish, it is less likely he would feel relieved, especially if it caused a serious issue. Therefore, the scenario that would most likely lead to relief would be the one he considered less problematic.

A:b. Spilled a drink on a guest.

Zara feels relieved, which suggests that the outcome is not negative or at least it is something she can handle positively. Since Zara expected that if her dessert failed to set, she could still explain the innovative concept and the judges might appreciate her creativity, this scenario would not be as negative for her. On the other hand, if the judges found her dessert too sweet, it would be dangerous and likely not leave her feeling relieved. Therefore, the reason for her relief is more likely to be related to the dessert failing to set rather than being criticized for being too sweet.

A:a. Failed to set

- Zachary expects that there might be some minor issues during the fashion show.
- He thinks that if a model trips, it would be safe and can be quickly resolved.
- He also thinks that if his collection receives mixed reviews, it would be dangerous for his reputation.
- Since Zachary feels relieved, it suggests that the situation that occurred was not harmful to his reputation or future opportunities.
- Therefore, it is more likely that the minor issue, such as a model tripping, occurred rather than his collection receiving mixed reviews, which he considered dangerous.

A:b. Model tripped on the runway.

- Charles is preparing for the harvest season by planting a new crop variety.
- He expects challenges during the growing season.
- He believes that if there is a pest infestation, it would be safe because he can apply pest control measures.
- He also believes that if there is a drought, it would be dangerous because it could lead to a significant loss in yield and income.
- The question states that Charles feels relieved, which suggests that the situation he was worried about did not occur.
- Since Charles would feel relieved if he could effectively manage the challenge, and he was confident in managing a pest infestation with pest control measures, it is likely that he experienced a pest infestation and not a drought.

A:b. Pest infestation.

Rachel feels relieved after presenting her bridge design to the city council. If the council had questioned the cost-effectiveness, Rachel would have considered it dangerous because it could lead to the project being canceled or delayed, which would not be a cause for relief. On the other hand, if the council questioned the structural integrity, Rachel would see it as an opportunity to improve the design and ensure public safety, which would be a positive outcome for her. Since Rachel feels relieved, it is more likely that the council questioned the structural integrity, which she views as a safe concern that she can address.

A:b. Questioned the structural integrity.
