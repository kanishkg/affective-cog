The question asks about Helen's feelings. The story says that Helen expects a challenging debate. She thinks that getting grilled by the moderator is safe and facing a personal attack is dangerous. She practices her arguments and counterarguments. The story does not say whether she actually got grilled or faced a personal attack.

Since the story does not provide any information about whether Helen actually got grilled or faced a personal attack, we cannot definitively choose either option 'a' or 'b'. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information that is provided.

Helen expects that the debate may have some challenging moments. She thinks that if she gets grilled by the moderator, it would be safe since it would show her ability to handle tough questions. This suggests that she is not particularly worried about being grilled by the moderator.

On the other hand, Helen thinks that if her opponent launches a personal attack, it would be dangerous since it could damage her reputation and distract from her policy proposals. This suggests that she is more concerned about being personally attacked by her opponent.

Based on this, it is more likely that Helen is feeling resigned because she is worried about being personally attacked by her opponent. Therefore, the best guess is:

**A: b. Personal attack from her opponent**
