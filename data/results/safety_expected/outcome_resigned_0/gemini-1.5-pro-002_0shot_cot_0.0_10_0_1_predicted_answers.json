        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says that Sarah thinks snowfall would be safe and make the hike more picturesque. It also says that she thinks fog would be dangerous as she could get lost and injured. The question asks if Sarah feels resigned. Resigned implies accepting something undesirable. Since Sarah views snowfall as positive, she wouldn't feel resigned if she encountered it.  Therefore, she must have encountered fog.\n\nA:b. Fog\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nJulian thinks that if the investors criticize the product's market fit, it would be *safe*.  He thinks that if they question the long-term viability, it would be *dangerous*. The question states that Julian feels *resigned*.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Helen *expects* challenging moments, including the possibility of being grilled by the moderator or facing a personal attack.  It doesn't say that either of these things actually happened.  The question asks what made Helen feel resigned, but the passage doesn't mention Helen feeling resigned at all. Since the question asks about something that didn't happen in the story, we can only guess. The passage says she considers being grilled by the moderator \"safe\" and a personal attack \"dangerous\".  \"Resigned\" implies acceptance of a negative outcome.  Therefore, it's more likely she'd feel resigned after a personal attack, which she considers dangerous.\n\nA:a. Personal attack from her opponent\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says Penelope *expects* there might be technical issues, and considers both a broken string and sound system malfunction. However, it doesn't say that either of these actually happened.  The question asks what happened to make Penelope feel *resigned*. Since the passage says she considers a broken string \"safe\" because she has a backup, it wouldn't make her feel resigned. A sound system malfunction, which she considers \"dangerous\", is more likely to make her feel resigned.\n\nA:b. Sound system malfunction\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe question asks about Zara feeling resigned. The passage states that Zara considers the dessert failing to set as \"safe\" because she can explain her concept. If it's too sweet, she considers it \"dangerous\" as it shows a lack of skill.

It says he *thinks* how he would handle these situations *if* they occur. However, the passage doesn't say that either of these events actually happened.  The question asks what Charles *experienced*. Since the passage doesn't say he experienced either, the best answer is that neither happened. However, we have to choose between the two provided options. The question states Charles feels resigned. Resigned implies acceptance of a negative outcome. Charles views drought as dangerous, and pest infestation as something manageable. Therefore, it's more likely he'd feel resigned about a drought.\n\nA:a. Drought\n"
