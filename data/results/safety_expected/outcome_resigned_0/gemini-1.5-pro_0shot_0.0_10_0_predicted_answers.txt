A: b. Fog 

A: b. 

A: b. Caused an explosion 

A: b. Personal attack from her opponent 

**Explanation:**

While we don't know the actual outcome, the passage highlights Helen's concern about a potential personal attack being "dangerous." This implies it would affect her more negatively than being grilled, which she considers "safe." So, if she felt resigned, it's more likely due to a personal attack damaging her campaign. 

## Analyzing Penelope's Situation

We know Penelope anticipates two potential issues: a broken guitar string and a sound system malfunction. She considers the former safe due to having a backup guitar, while the latter is seen as dangerous with the potential to ruin the concert.

Unfortunately, the provided text doesn't explicitly state which issue, if any, Penelope actually encountered during her performance. However, we can analyze her emotional state to make an educated guess.

## Making an Educated Guess

The keyword here is "resigned." Resignation implies acceptance of something negative or undesirable that cannot be changed. 

*   **Broken Guitar String:**  This scenario wouldn't necessarily lead to resignation, as Penelope has a backup plan and can quickly recover. 
*   **Sound System Malfunction:** This event aligns more with the feeling of resignation. If the sound system fails, it's beyond Penelope's control and could indeed ruin the concert experience, leaving her with no choice but to accept the situation.

Therefore, based on the available information and the emotion described, the most likely scenario is:

**A: b. Sound system malfunction.** Penelope likely experienced a sound system malfunction, leading to her feeling resigned. 

## Analyzing Xavier's Situation:

We know Xavier is nervous about potential issues during the dinner service. He believes spilling a drink would be "safe" while serving the wrong dish would be "dangerous". This implies he is concerned about the potential consequences of his actions. 

Feeling "resigned" suggests something negative has already happened, and Xavier has accepted the outcome. He wouldn't feel resigned before the dinner service even begins.

## Evaluating Options:

**a. Spilled a drink on a guest:**  This aligns with Xavier's belief that it would be a "safe" mistake, but it doesn't necessarily lead to feeling resigned. He would likely try to rectify the situation.

**b. Served the wrong dish:** This aligns with Xavier's belief that it's a "dangerous" mistake with potentially severe consequences.  If this happened, feeling resigned would be a plausible reaction, especially after the fact.

## Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the most likely answer is: 

**A: b. Served the wrong dish.**  Xavier likely served the wrong dish, leading to a negative outcome, and now feels resigned to the situation. 

## Analyzing Zara's Situation:

We know Zara is worried about two potential issues: her dessert not setting and her dessert being too sweet. She believes a failure to set is **safe** (meaning she's okay with it) because she can explain the concept. However, she thinks being too sweet is **dangerous** (meaning she's worried about it) as it reflects poorly on her skills.

The question asks about Zara feeling **resigned**. Resigned implies accepting something negative without trying to change it. 

**Therefore, the answer should be the outcome Zara considers "safe" and is willing to accept.**

## Answer:

A: a. Failed to set. Zara is more likely resigned to her dessert failing to set as she considers that outcome "safe" and is prepared to explain it. 

## Analyzing Zachary's Situation

Based on the information provided, Zachary clearly fears the potential negative impact of mixed reviews on his career. He considers this scenario "dangerous" due to the potential damage to his reputation and future prospects. 

A model tripping, while not ideal, is viewed as a common and manageable issue with minimal long-term consequences. 

Therefore, if Zachary feels resigned, it's more likely due to the outcome he dreaded the most.

**A: a. Collection received mixed reviews.** 
<br> 
Zachary's feeling of resignation suggests his collection received mixed reviews, which he considers a dangerous outcome for his career. 

## Analyzing Charles' Situation:

We know Charles is worried about two potential problems:

*   **Pest infestation:** He believes this is **safe** because he can use pest control.
*   **Drought:** He believes this is **dangerous** due to potential yield and income loss. 

The question asks if Charles feels **resigned**. Resignation implies accepting something negative that cannot be easily controlled. 

Therefore, we need to identify the event more likely to cause feelings of resignation.

## Answer:

A: a. Drought. 

**Explanation:** Charles is more likely to feel resigned if he experienced a drought since he considers it dangerous and potentially uncontrollable compared to a pest infestation. 

A: a. Questioned the cost-effectiveness. 

**Explanation:** Rachel feels that questions about cost-effectiveness are dangerous as they might lead to project cancellation. Her feeling resigned suggests the council raised the dangerous question.
