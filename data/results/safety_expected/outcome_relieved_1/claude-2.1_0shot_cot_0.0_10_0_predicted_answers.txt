Sarah is a solo hiker navigating a challenging mountain trail. She expects some adverse weather events. If there's fog, she can safely navigate using her compass and map. If there's snowfall, it could be dangerous and she could get stranded or hypothermic. The question asks if Sarah encountered fog or snowfall, given that she feels relieved. Since snowfall could strand her or cause hypothermia but fog would allow her to safely navigate, if Sarah feels relieved it likely means she encountered fog and not dangerous snowfall.
