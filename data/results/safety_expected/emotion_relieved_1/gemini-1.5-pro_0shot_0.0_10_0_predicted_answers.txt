## Analyzing Penelope's Potential Feelings:

We need to consider Penelope's expectations and the actual event to determine her feelings. 

*   **Expectation:** Penelope anticipated potential technical issues and considered sound system malfunctions as safe and fixable. 
*   **Reality:** The sound system malfunctioned, causing poor audio quality. 

Based on this, we can eliminate options:

*   **a. devastated:**  This is unlikely as Penelope expected technical issues and wouldn't be devastated by a predictable problem.
*   **b. relieved:** There's no indication she was anxious beforehand, so relief wouldn't be the appropriate emotion.
*   **d. surprised:** Since she anticipated such problems, surprise wouldn't be the dominant emotion.

Therefore, the most likely answer is: 

**A: c. resigned.** Penelope likely feels resigned to the situation, accepting the sound system issue as an unfortunate but expected part of live performances. 

A: a. devastated.

## Analyzing Zara's Possible Feelings:

**a. devastated:** This option implies Zara feels extremely upset and heartbroken. While the criticism might be disappointing, the text doesn't indicate she'd be devastated.

**b. resigned:** This suggests Zara accepts the situation with a sense of disappointment but without resistance. We don't have enough information to determine if she'd passively accept the critique.

**c. surprised:** The story tells us Zara anticipated the possibility of the dessert being too sweet. Therefore, she wouldn't be surprised by the judges' feedback.

**d. relieved:**  This option aligns best with the information provided. Zara considered the potential criticism and viewed it as a defensible choice, a "bold move."  Therefore, she would likely feel relieved it wasn't a technical failure that could cost her the competition.
