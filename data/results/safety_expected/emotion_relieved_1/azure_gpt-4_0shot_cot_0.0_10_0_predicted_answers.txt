Sarah is a solo hiker who is aware of the potential for adverse weather events on the trail. She has prepared for the possibility of fog by planning to use her compass and map to navigate. When she encounters fog, it is something she expected and prepared for, so she is not likely to be surprised. Since she has a plan, she is also not likely to feel devastated. Being resigned implies a sense of acceptance without the ability to change the situation, which doesn't quite fit since she has a plan to deal with the fog. Relief typically comes from the resolution of a worry or problem, but in this case, Sarah is encountering a challenge she anticipated, not overcoming one. However, since she has prepared for this exact situation, she might feel a sense of relief that she can handle it with her compass and map.

A:d. relieved.

Julian expects the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch. He thinks that if the investors question the long-term viability of the product, it would be a safe indicator of a future partnership. Since the investors did question the long-term viability, this aligns with Julian's expectations and his belief that such a question is a positive sign. Therefore, Julian would likely feel positive about this development.

A:c. relieved.

Ben is conducting an experiment and is aware of the potential risks, including an explosion. He has prepared safety measures to contain a small explosion, indicating that he is prepared for such an eventuality. When the explosion occurs, it is described as small, which falls within the scope of what Ben has anticipated and prepared for. Therefore, Ben is likely not devastated, as he expected this could happen and took precautions. He is also unlikely to be surprised, as he considered the possibility of an explosion. Between 'resigned' and 'relieved,' 'relieved' seems more appropriate because the safety measures he put in place worked as intended, and the situation remained under control.

A:b. relieved.

Helen expects that the debate may have challenging moments, so she is prepared for various scenarios.
She thinks that if her opponent launches a personal attack, it would be safe for her because it could backfire on the opponent and make them look unprofessional.
Since Helen has anticipated this possibility and sees it as potentially advantageous to her, she is unlikely to feel resigned, devastated, or surprised.
Given that she sees a personal attack as something that could work in her favor, she is most likely to feel relieved when it happens.

A:b. relieved.

Penelope was prepared for technical issues and believed that if the sound system malfunctions, it would be safe because the technical team can fix it promptly. This indicates that she had anticipated the possibility and had a plan in place, which would likely prevent her from feeling devastated. Since she expected that the technical team could handle sound system issues, she might not feel surprised either. The options "relieved" and "resigned" remain. "Relieved" would imply that she is comforted by the situation, which is unlikely since the malfunction is causing poor audio quality. "Resigned" would imply that she has accepted the situation, which seems more fitting given that she had anticipated potential technical issues and seems prepared to deal with them.

A:c. resigned.

Xavier is preparing for a group of influential guests and expects issues during the service.
He considers serving the wrong dish as a safe mistake because it can be quickly rectified.
However, he did not anticipate serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions, which is a more serious error than he had prepared for.
Given that this mistake could have health implications for the guest and reflects poorly on the restaurant's service, Xavier is likely to feel very negative about the situation.

A:d. devastated.

Zara anticipated that there might be issues with her dessert. She considered the possibility of her dessert being criticized for being too sweet, and she felt prepared to defend this as a bold choice. Since she was expecting this criticism and had a defense ready, it's unlikely that she would feel resigned or devastated, as those emotions would imply she felt defeated or overwhelmed by the criticism. Instead, since she was prepared for this particular criticism, it's more likely that she would feel relieved that the criticism was something she expected and could handle. Therefore, the option that she feels surprised doesn't fit the context because she had already considered this scenario.

A:c. relieved.

Zachary expected that there might be some minor issues during the fashion show, indicating that he was prepared for the possibility of not everything going perfectly. He also thought that if his collection received mixed reviews, it would be safe and could lead to interesting discussions and improvements. Since the collection did receive mixed reviews, which is something he considered a safe outcome, it is unlikely that he feels surprised or devastated. He probably doesn't feel resigned either, as that might imply giving up or accepting defeat, which doesn't align with his perspective on mixed reviews being an opportunity for discussion and improvement. Therefore, the most likely emotion he would feel is relief, as the situation turned out as he considered safe, and not the dangerous scenario of a model tripping.

Charles has prepared for the possibility of a drought by planning to use water-saving techniques and irrigation. Since he has anticipated this challenge and has measures in place to deal with it, he is unlikely to feel devastated or surprised. Between relieved and resigned, relieved would imply that he is comforted by the fact that he is prepared, while resigned would suggest a sense of acceptance of the situation without necessarily being happy about it. Given that he has prepared for this exact scenario, it's more likely that he feels a sense of relief that he can handle the situation rather than mere resignation.

Rachel expects the city council to have concerns and questions about her design. She has considered two possible areas of concern: cost-effectiveness and structural integrity. Rachel believes that if the council questions the cost-effectiveness, it would be safe and could lead to a better solution. Since the council did question the cost-effectiveness, and this is the scenario she deemed safe, it is likely that Rachel feels relieved because the situation aligns with her safer expectation and does not threaten her reputation.
