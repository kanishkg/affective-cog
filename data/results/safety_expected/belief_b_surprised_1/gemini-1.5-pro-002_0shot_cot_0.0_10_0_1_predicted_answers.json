        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Sarah \"expects the weather to be pleasant\". This implies she wasn't prepared for bad weather, including fog.  The surprise she feels at the sudden fog suggests she hadn't considered this possibility or its impact on her safety.  The question asks about her thoughts on safety regarding BOTH snowfall and fog, and since she expected pleasant weather, it's unlikely she thought she could safely navigate either.\n\nA:a. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered fog and could safely navigate if she encountered snowfall.  It's more likely that Sarah didn't consider the safety implications of either fog or snowfall, expecting good weather. The passage doesn't give us enough information to determine if she thought she could navigate one condition better than the other. The question is likely trying to trick us with specific scenarios when the text only tells us she expected pleasant weather.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says, \"Helen expects the debate to go smoothly.\" This implies she didn't anticipate any unpleasant surprises, such as a personal attack.  Since she prepared arguments and counterarguments, she likely considered being grilled by the moderator as part of a standard debate and thus, not a surprise.

Helen thought that it would be dangerous if her opponent launched a personal attack and safe if she got grilled by the moderator.  She prepared for the expected grilling by the moderator, but the personal attack was unexpected, hence the surprise.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Xavier \"expects the dinner service to go smoothly without any issues.\" This implies he didn't anticipate any problems, including serving the wrong dish or spilling a drink.  Therefore, he likely believed both scenarios were unlikely and wouldn't cause significant issues. The question asks about Xavier's surprise, indicating something unexpected happened. Since he served the wrong dish, it's clear he didn't anticipate this problem.\n\nA:a. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest. Serving the wrong dish, especially to someone with dietary restrictions, can be dangerous. Spilling a drink, while embarrassing, is less likely to cause serious harm. However, the passage implies Xavier didn't expect *either* issue to occur. The question is about Xavier's surprise, and the story indicates he was surprised by the kitchen's mistake and serving the wrong dish.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Zachary \"expects the fashion show to go smoothly without any issues.\" This implies he didn't anticipate any problems, including a model tripping or receiving mixed reviews.  Since he was surprised by the mixed reviews, it means he didn't expect them.  The question is about what he thought about the *safety* of the show.  Mixed reviews don't pose a safety risk, while a model tripping could.  Therefore, he likely thought both scenarios would be free of safety issues, but he was more surprised by the reviews because he expected a positive reception.\n\nA:a. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.  While the passage doesn't explicitly mention his thoughts on a model tripping, it implies he expected the show to go smoothly, suggesting he didn't anticipate any safety issues. Mixed reviews are not a safety concern.\n"
