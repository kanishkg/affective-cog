Since an explosion occurred and Ben felt surprised, he likely did not expect it and considered it an unsafe outcome. There is no information to suggest he had a differentiated expectation of safety between a toxic gas and an explosion, so we can assume he thought both outcomes would be dangerous. However, as per the given options, there is no choice stating that Ben thought both would be dangerous.

Since the question asks about both the explosion and the production of a toxic gas, we can infer that Ben did not anticipate or desire any dangerous scenarios. Since the options provided only consider either the explosion or the toxic gas as safe, neither completely aligns with Ben's initial expectation of a safe experiment. However, since Ben was surprised by the explosion, this suggests that he did not expect it to happen and therefore did not consider it safe.

However, the options provided seem to force a choice between the two unlikely considerations. Since we have to choose from the options provided, and none of them align perfectly with the given information, we will have to make an educated guess. Since breaking a guitar string is a more common occurrence for musicians and can often be quickly remedied, whereas a malfunctioning sound system could have a more significant impact on the concert, it would be reasonable to infer that the sound system malfunctioning would be considered the more serious issue, had she considered it.\n\nA: a.

Therefore, Rachel likely believed the safety (structural integrity) of her design was not in question, and thus would consider it safe from this standpoint.
