- It is stated that Sarah expected the weather to be pleasant.
- We can infer that Sarah did not expect to encounter snowfall or fog.
- Since we cannot infer anything about Sarah's thoughts on the safety of encountering snowfall or fog, we can choose the option that is more likely.
- It is more likely that Sarah would think it would be dangerous to encounter snowfall, as snowfall can make trails slippery and difficult to navigate.
- Therefore, we can choose option a.
Answer: a. Sarah thought that it would be dangerous if she encountered fog and could safely navigate if she encountered snowfall.

The question asks about Penelope's thoughts on the safety of her concert if her guitar string broke or if the sound system malfunctioned. The story does not mention Penelope's thoughts on these specific scenarios. However, we can make an educated guess based on common sense.

It is generally more dangerous if a guitar string breaks during a performance, as it could potentially cause injury to the performer or audience members. A malfunctioning sound system, while frustrating, is less likely to be dangerous.

Therefore, it is more likely that Penelope would have been more concerned about the safety of her concert if her guitar string broke, compared to if the sound system malfunctioned.

A: a. Penelope thought that it would be dangerous if the sound system malfunctioned and safe if her guitar string broke.

The question asks what Zara thought about the safety of her dessert if it failed to set or if it was criticized for being too sweet.

a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert was criticized for being too sweet and safe if it failed to set.
b. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.

The passage does not mention anything about Zara's thoughts on the safety of her dessert, so we cannot logically choose either option 'a' or 'b'.

However, if we had to choose one of the options, option 'b' is more logical because it is more common to think that a dessert that fails to set is dangerous (e.g., it could contain harmful bacteria) than a dessert that is criticized for being too sweet.

Therefore, the best guess is 'b'.

A:b. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.
A:e. none of the above

- The story does not mention anything about Rachel's thought about the safety of her design.
- So we cannot give an answer from the provided context.
- However, we can make an assumption based on common sense.
- If the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness of the design, it is more likely that Rachel thought it would be safe.
- This is because cost-effectiveness is related to the budget and resources, which are not directly related to the safety of the design.
- On the other hand, if the city council questioned the structural integrity of the design, it is more likely that Rachel thought it would be dangerous.
- This is because structural integrity is directly related to the safety of the bridge.

Based on the above analysis, the best guess would be 'b'.

A: b. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.
