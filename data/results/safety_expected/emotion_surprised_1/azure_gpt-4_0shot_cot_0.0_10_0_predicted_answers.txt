Sarah expected the weather to be pleasant, so the sudden fog and reduced visibility were not anticipated.
Sarah thinks she can safely navigate using her compass and map if she sees fog, which means she feels prepared for this situation.
The options "resigned" and "devastated" suggest a negative emotional state that would be more appropriate if she encountered snowfall, which she believes could be dangerous.
The option "relieved" does not fit the scenario because the fog is a challenge, even if she feels prepared to handle it.
The best fit, given the unexpected nature of the fog, is that Sarah would be "surprised" by the sudden change in weather.

A:c. surprised.

Ben is conducting an experiment and expects it to go smoothly, which implies he is not anticipating any negative outcomes. However, he has considered the possibility of an explosion and has safety measures in place, indicating he is prepared for such an event, albeit he does not expect it to happen. When the mixture does cause a small explosion, it is an unexpected event, but since Ben has prepared for it, his primary emotion is likely not devastation or resignation. Between surprise and relief, since the explosion was not expected, surprise is the more likely initial reaction. Relief might come into play if the safety measures worked effectively, but the immediate response to an unexpected explosion would more likely be surprise.

A:a. surprised.

Xavier is preparing for a high-end dinner service and expects it to go smoothly. He has considered the potential mistakes that could happen and has categorized serving the wrong dish as "safe" because he believes he can quickly correct the mistake. However, serving the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions is a serious error and could have health implications for the guest. This is not a simple mistake that can be easily rectified with a quick replacement and an apology, as it could potentially harm the guest. Given the gravity of the situation and Xavier's role as a waiter who aims to provide impeccable service, it is likely that he would feel a strong negative emotion.

A:c. devastated. Xavier likely feels devastated because he has made a significant error that could affect the guest's health and the restaurant's reputation.

Zachary expects the fashion show to go smoothly, which means he is optimistic about the outcome. He also thinks that if his collection receives mixed reviews, it would be safe and could lead to positive discussions and improvements. Since the collection did receive mixed reviews, which is a scenario he considered safe, it is likely that he feels neither surprised nor devastated. Between 'resigned' and 'relieved,' 'resigned' would imply that he has accepted something unpleasant that he cannot change, while 'relieved' would imply that he has been freed from something worrisome. Since Zachary thought mixed reviews could be beneficial, 'relieved' seems to be the more appropriate emotion.

Rachel expects the city council to approve her design without any issues, which means she is confident in her design. She has considered two possible concerns from the council: cost-effectiveness and structural integrity. Rachel believes that if the council questions the cost-effectiveness, it would be safe and could lead to a better solution. This implies that she is prepared for such a discussion and sees it as a constructive possibility. On the other hand, she thinks that questions about structural integrity would be dangerous for her reputation. Since the council questioned the cost-effectiveness, which Rachel sees as a safe and potentially beneficial outcome, she is likely to feel relieved that they did not question the structural integrity, which she feared would be damaging to her reputation.
