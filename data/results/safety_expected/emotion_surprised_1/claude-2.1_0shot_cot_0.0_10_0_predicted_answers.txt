Step 1) Sarah is hiking solo on a mountain trail. She expects good weather. 
Step 2) If there's fog, she plans to use her compass and map to navigate. If there's snow, it could be dangerous and she could get stranded or hypothermic.
Step 3) While hiking, Sarah encounters sudden fog which reduces visibility.
Step 4) The fog was something Sarah had planned for. She expected to navigate with her compass and map if there was fog. She would likely feel relieved that it was fog rather than dangerous snow.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step-by-step:
- Julian expects no challenges or questions from the investors since he is confident in his pitch
- He thinks if investors question long-term viability, it would indicate a future partnership
- The investors question the long-term viability after his pitch
- So based on Julian's expectations, he should feel relieved that they questioned long-term viability as this indicates potential future partnership

A: a. relieved

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ben is a scientist conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound 
- He expects the experiment to go smoothly without any issues
- He thinks a small, contained explosion would be safe due to his safety measures
- He thinks producing a toxic gas would be dangerous and could harm people
- When he mixes the chemicals, there is a small explosion in the lab
- Even though Ben prepared for a small explosion, he likely still feels surprised this happened

A: d. surprised

I chose surprised as the best option. Even though Ben anticipated the possibility of a small, contained explosion, he still expected the experiment to generally go smoothly. So when the volatile reaction caused an explosion, he was likely caught off guard and felt surprised this occurred despite his precautions.

Zara expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received. She thinks criticism for being too sweet would be safe to defend as a bold move. However, if her dessert fails to set, she thinks that would be dangerous and could cost her the competition. The judges criticize her dessert for being too sweet. This matches what Zara thought would be a safe criticism. So she likely feels relieved rather than surprised, resigned, or devastated.

A: d. relieved

Rachel is an engineer who designed a new bridge for a busy city intersection. She expected the city council to approve her design without issues. Rachel thought that if the council questioned the cost-effectiveness, it would be safe as it could lead to optimizing resources and a better solution. If they questioned the structural integrity, she felt it would be dangerous and damage her reputation as a reliable engineer. 

When Rachel presented her design, the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness and suggested exploring alternatives. This is what Rachel thought would be a "safe" line of questioning. So she likely feels relieved that they did not question the structural integrity, which she saw as more damaging.
