Based on the story, Ben had a hypothesis that if the chemical mixture caused an explosion, it would be safe as he had safety measures in place. However, he recognized that if it produced a toxic gas, that could be dangerous and harm people. When the mixture did produce a toxic gas, Ben had to evacuate the lab. So Ben recognized the possibility of unexpected dangerous outcomes from the experiment and planned for that possibility.

A: a. Yes

Ben expected the possibility of unexpected dangerous outcomes from the experiment, specifically the production of a toxic gas. Even though he hoped the explosion would be contained safely, he acknowledged the experiment could also produce dangerous gases.
