        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Sarah is a solo hiker on a challenging mountain trail.\n2. She has considered two possible weather scenarios:\n   - Fog: She thinks she can safely navigate using her compass and map.\n   - Snowfall: She considers this dangerous due to the risk of getting stranded and hypothermia.\n3. The question states that Sarah experiences sudden fog and reduced visibility.\n4. The question also mentions that Sarah feels surprised by this.\n5. If Sarah had expected adverse weather events, she likely wouldn't feel surprised when encountering fog.\n6. The fact that Sarah feels surprised suggests that she did not anticipate encountering adverse weather conditions during her hike.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it appears that Sarah did not expect to encounter adverse weather events.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Julian had two expectations before the pitch:\n   - If investors question long-term viability, it would be a safe indicator of a future partnership.\n   - If investors criticize market fit, it would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch.\n\n2. During the pitch, the investors questioned the long-term viability of the product.\n\n3. This aligns with Julian's first expectation, which he considered a safe indicator.\n\n4. The question states that Julian feels surprised by this.\n\n5. If Julian is surprised, it suggests that the investors' response did not match his expectations.\n\n6. Therefore, Julian must have expected the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch, not the long-term viability.\n\nA:a. Yes"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Ben had considered two possible outcomes:\n   - A small, contained explosion (which he thought would be safe)\n   - Production of toxic gas (which he thought would be dangerous)\n2. The actual result was a small explosion in the lab.\n3. Ben had anticipated that a small explosion could occur and thought it would be safe.\n4. The question states that Ben feels surprised by the outcome.\n5. If Ben is surprised, it suggests that something unexpected happened.\n6. Even though he had considered the possibility of an explosion, his surprise indicates that the actual event was different from what he had anticipated.\n7. This implies that Ben did not fully expect or prepare for the exact nature or intensity of the explosion that occurred.\n\nGiven that Ben feels surprised, we can conclude that there were some unexpected aspects to the outcome, even though he had considered the possibility of an explosion.\n\nA:b. Yes"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Helen prepared for the debate by practicing her arguments and counterarguments.\n2. She considered two possible scenarios:\n   a. Her opponent launching a personal attack\n   b. Getting grilled by the moderator\n3. Helen thought a personal attack would be \"safe\" as it could backfire on her opponent.\n4. She believed being grilled by the moderator would be \"dangerous\" for her.\n5. During the actual debate, her opponent launched a personal attack.\n6. The question states that Helen feels surprised by this.\n7. If Helen feels surprised, it suggests she didn't fully expect this to happen.\n8. However, the fact that she had considered this scenario in her preparation indicates that she did expect challenging moments in the debate, even if the specific event surprised her.\n\nGiven this analysis, although Helen feels surprised by the personal attack, she did expect challenging moments in the debate. Her preparation for different scenarios shows she anticipated difficulties.\n\nA:b. Yes"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Penelope had considered potential issues before the concert.\n2. She specifically thought about two scenarios:\n   - A sound system malfunction\n   - A guitar string breaking\n3. For the sound system malfunction, Penelope thought it would be \"safe\" because the technical team could fix it promptly.\n4. This indicates that Penelope did expect the possibility of technical issues, including sound system problems.\n5. The question states that Penelope feels surprised when the sound system actually malfunctions.\n6. However, feeling surprised doesn't necessarily mean she didn't expect it at all. It could be surprise at the timing or the specific nature of the malfunction.\n7. The key point is that Penelope had considered the possibility of technical issues beforehand.\n\nA:a. Yes"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Zara anticipated two possible outcomes for her dessert:\n   - It might be criticized for being too sweet\n   - It might fail to set properly\n\n2. Zara considered the criticism of being too sweet as \"safe\" because:\n   - She could defend it as a bold move\n   - This implies she was prepared for this criticism\n\n3.
