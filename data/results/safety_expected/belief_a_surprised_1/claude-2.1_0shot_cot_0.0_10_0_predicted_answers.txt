 <Thought: Let's think step by step:
From the story, we know that Sarah is an experienced solo hiker who is prepared for adverse weather events on the mountain. Specifically:
1) She thinks that if she sees fog, she can safely navigate using her compass and map. So she expected to potentially encounter fog.
2) She also considers the possibility of snowfall and the dangers of getting stranded or hypothermia. So she expected the possibility of snowfall as well.

Therefore, Sarah expected that she might encounter adverse weather events like fog or snow during her hike. She came prepared to deal with them.

Based on the story, Julian expected the investors to question the long-term viability of the product. He thought that if they did that, it would be a safe indicator of a future partnership. However, he thought that if they criticized the product's market fit, that would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch. 

When the investors questioned the long-term viability, Julian felt surprised. This matches what Julian expected them to question. Therefore, he did not expect the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch.

A: a. No

1) If the mixture caused a small, contained explosion, he thought it would be safe because he had safety measures in place. 
2) If the mixture produced a toxic gas, he thought that would be dangerous and could harm people.

When the actual outcome was a small explosion, Ben felt surprised. This indicates that he did not expect this particular outcome that actually occurred.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Penelope is preparing for her first live concert after months of practice 
- She thinks if the sound system malfunctions, it would be safe to fix
- She thinks if her guitar string breaks, it could be dangerous 
- The sound system ends up malfunctioning during her performance
- The question asks if Penelope expected any technical issues during the concert

A: a. No

I chose 'No' because the passage says Penelope thinks it would be safe if the sound system malfunctioned since the technical team could fix it promptly. This suggests she did not expect issues like the sound system malfunctioning during her concert.

- Charles is preparing for harvest by planting a new crop variety
- He thinks drought would be safe since he can use water-saving techniques and irrigation
- He thinks pest infestation would be dangerous since it could spread and be hard to manage
- Unusual weather caused a drought during the growing season
- The question asks if Charles expected any challenges during the growing season

Charles did not expect drought specifically, even though he planned for potential drought. He only identified pest infestation as a expected danger, not drought. So he did not expect this specific challenge.
 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Rachel is an engineer working on a new bridge design for a busy city intersection
- She thinks questions about cost-effectiveness would be safe as it could optimize resources and lead to a better solution
- She thinks questions about structural integrity would be dangerous as it could damage her reputation
- Rachel presents her design to the city council for approval 
- The city council questions the cost-effectiveness of her design and suggests exploring alternatives
- The question asks if Rachel expected the city council to have concerns and questions about her design

Rachel seemed to anticipate and be prepared for questions about cost-effectiveness. She did not expect questions about structural integrity. But she presented to the council expecting review and feedback. So while the specific concern about cost may have surprised her, she likely expected the council would have some concerns and questions.

A: b. Yes
