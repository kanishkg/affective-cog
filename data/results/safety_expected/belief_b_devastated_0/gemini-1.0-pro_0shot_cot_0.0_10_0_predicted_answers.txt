The passage does not mention anything about Zara's thoughts on the safety of her dessert. However, we can make an educated guess based on common sense. If a dessert fails to set, it may not be safe to eat because it may contain raw ingredients that could cause food poisoning. On the other hand, a dessert that is criticized for being too sweet is still safe to eat, although it may not be as enjoyable.

Based on this reasoning, we can choose option **a**:

A: a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the fact that the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness of the design.

Answer:
a. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the cost-effectiveness and safe if they questioned the structural integrity.
