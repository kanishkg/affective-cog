Given that explosions and toxic gases are both hazardous, but the given options force a choice between the two, the best approach is to infer which one he may have deemed less controlled or predictable. Explosions tend to be immediately disruptive and obviously dangerous.\n7.

There are two aspects mentioned: structural integrity and cost-effectiveness. Generally, questioning the structural integrity of a bridge design would be related to the bridge's ability to stand strong and secure, which is directly connected to safety. On the other hand, questioning the cost-effectiveness deals with the budget and financial aspects of the project, which doesn't have a direct impact on the physical safety of the design itself. Therefore, if Rachel is feeling resigned after the council's concerns about cost-effectiveness, it implies she felt that the bridge was safe as designed, even though they questioned its cost.\n\nA:b.
