The passage states that \"Helen expects that the debate may have some challenging moments.\" This suggests she anticipated and prepared for difficult questions or attacks.  The fact that she practices her arguments and counterarguments implies she views the debate as a challenging but not necessarily dangerous situation.  The text doesn't offer any clues about Helen viewing either scenario as specifically dangerous.  Since she's a politician, difficult questioning and personal attacks are likely seen as occupational hazards, rather than threats to her safety. Since the question asks about her feeling of safety specifically, and the text doesn't mention her considering either possibility as dangerous, neither option is directly supported. However, since the question forces a choice, option 'b' more closely aligns with potential concerns a politician might have. Personal attacks could be more unpredictable and potentially damaging to reputation than tough questions from a moderator, which are generally expected in a debate.\n\nA:b.

It's not that she thought it would be physically \"dangerous\", but rather that she found it challenging or demoralizing in a way she hadn't fully anticipated. The question is about what she thought about the \"safety\" of the debate, which could refer to her emotional or political safety, not just physical safety.
