Drought is generally more dangerous and difficult to control than pest infestations for crops.\n8. Farmers usually have more tools to combat pests (like pesticides) than to combat drought.\n9. Given that Charles feels resigned due to the drought, it's likely he sees drought as a more significant threat than pests.\n\nA:b. Charles thought that it would be dangerous if his crop was affected by drought and safe if it was infested with pests."
