The passage doesn't indicate she felt one scenario was safe and the other dangerous.  She prepared for both.\n"

This implies she considered the possibility of problems like sound system malfunctions beforehand.  It doesn't say she thought it would be *dangerous*, just that she anticipated it might happen.  There's no mention of her thoughts on a broken guitar string, so we can't infer anything about her considering it dangerous or safe.  Since the question asks about her thoughts on *safety*, and the passage only mentions her anticipating technical difficulties, neither scenario is described as being considered dangerous.\n\nA:b. Penelope thought that it would be dangerous if her guitar string broke and safe if the sound system malfunctioned.  Neither of these scenarios is described as dangerous in the text.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Zachary *expected* there might be some minor issues.  A model tripping would be a minor issue, so he likely considered this possibility and wouldn't be resigned about it. Mixed reviews are also a possibility and could be considered a minor issue.  Since he was prepared for minor issues, he wouldn't be resigned. The question is tricky because it uses the word \"safety\".  Neither a tripped model nor mixed reviews are truly matters of \"safety,\" but the question forces us to consider them in that context.  A model tripping *could* be a safety issue (minor injury), while mixed reviews are not a safety issue at all.  Since the question asks what Zachary thought about the *safety* of the show *if* these things happened, we can infer that he considered the possibility of both.\n\nA:a. Zachary thought that it would be dangerous if a model tripped and safe if his collection received mixed reviews.\n"

Cost-effectiveness relates to the budget, not safety.  If the council questioned the structural integrity, Rachel would likely be concerned about the safety of her design. If the council questioned the cost-effectiveness, it wouldn't necessarily mean the design is unsafe, just potentially too expensive.\n\nA:a. Rachel thought that it would be dangerous if the city council questioned the structural integrity and safe if they questioned the cost-effectiveness.\n"
