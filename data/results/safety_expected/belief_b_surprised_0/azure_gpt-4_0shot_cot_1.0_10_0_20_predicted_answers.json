Thus, he likely thought that his crop would be safe even if it was infested with pests, since he did not anticipate any issues at all. The question does not provide information about Charles's expectations regarding drought, but it focuses on his surprise about the pest infestation which suggests that this was the unexpected factor for him.\n\nA:a.
