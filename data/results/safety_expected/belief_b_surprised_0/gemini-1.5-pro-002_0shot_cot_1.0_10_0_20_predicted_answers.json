The passage implies Xavier expected a smooth service with no mishaps at all.\n\nb. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he spilled a drink on a guest and safe if he served the wrong dish. Incorrect. The passage does not differentiate which mishap would be more dangerous than the other in Xavier's mind, only that he did not expect either. Serving the wrong dish could also be dangerous for the guest depending on allergies.\n\nSince neither of the options accurately captures the nuance of Xavier's surprise and the passage doesn't specify which one he considered 'more' dangerous, these options aren't the best representation of Xavier's thoughts. However, if we must choose based solely on the options, the closest approximation of his mindset would be that both scenarios were considered unsafe as they would disrupt the smooth service he had meticulously planned. Unfortunately, this isn't an explicit option. Choosing between a and b is tricky since the context doesn'",

He was surprised when he spilled the drink, indicating he didn't anticipate such mishaps.\n\nA:b. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest.  Neither option reflects the passage correctly.  The passage indicates Xavier expected no problems at all and therefore likely considered both scenarios safe (or at least not dangerous). The question's options don't fully align with what can be inferred from the text.

A dessert failing to set is a technical baking issue that affects its structure and presentation, while being too sweet is a matter of taste preference. Zara, a passionate baker, would likely be more concerned about a technical failure affecting the structural integrity of her dessert than about subjective criticism of its sweetness.  A dessert that fails to set properly might be perceived as undercooked or unstable, which could be a safety concern.

Excessive sweetness, though potentially unpleasant, is also not generally a safety concern.  Since neither scenario truly poses a danger, and the question asks what Zara *thought*, the most likely answer is that she didn't perceive either as a safety issue.
