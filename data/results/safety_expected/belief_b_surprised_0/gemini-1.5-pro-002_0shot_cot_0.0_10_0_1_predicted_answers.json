        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Ben was surprised by the outcome of the experiment.  The experiment produced a toxic gas, forcing him to evacuate.

Ben was surprised by the toxic gas, indicating he believed the experiment would be safe.  The question's options don't offer \"safe in either scenario,\" so the closest answer is that he only anticipated danger from an explosion, not from a toxic gas release.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe question asks about Zara's expectation of safety concerning her dessert. The passage mentions that Zara \"expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received.\"  This implies she anticipates positive feedback. A criticism, even for excessive sweetness, might be perceived negatively, potentially jeopardizing her chances in the competition.  A dessert failing to set is a technical baking issue, not necessarily a safety concern.\n\nA:a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.  Zara would likely view criticism as a threat to her success, while a setting issue is a baking problem.\n"
