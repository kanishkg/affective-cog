The question doesn't provide information about Charles' thoughts on drought, but since he expected no issues, he likely considered his crop safe from drought.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Charles would have thought that pest infestation was dangerous and drought was not a concern (i.e., safe).\n\nA:b.

This indicates that Charles is optimistic and doesn't anticipate problems.\n4. Charles follows recommended cultivation practices, suggesting he believes he's doing everything right.\n5. Despite his expectations and efforts, Charles discovers that the crop is infested with pests.\n6. The question states that Charles feels surprised by this development.\n7. This surprise indicates that Charles did not expect pest infestation to be a problem.\n8. The question asks about Charles' thoughts on the safety of his crop in relation to pests and drought.\n9. Given that Charles is surprised by the pest infestation, it's likely he thought pests would not be a threat.\n10. The fact that he's surprised by pests suggests he probably considered them dangerous if they did occur.\n11. Since drought isn't mentioned in the story, we can assume Charles wasn't as concerned about it.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Charles likely thought pests were dangerous (since he's surprised by their occurrence) and drought was less of a concern (since it's not mentioned in his expectations).\n\nA:a.
