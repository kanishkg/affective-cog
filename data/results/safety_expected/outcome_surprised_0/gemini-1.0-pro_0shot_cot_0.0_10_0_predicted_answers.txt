Since I cannot find the answer to the question in the passage, I will have to guess.

Julian thinks that if the investors criticize the product's market fit, it would be safe as it would provide clear feedback for improvement. He thinks that if they question long-term viability, it would be dangerous because it might lead to a tepid investment without strong support.

Since Julian is surprised, it is more likely that the investors questioned the long-term viability of his product.

A: a. Questioned long-term viability
**A: a. Produced a toxic gas**

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Ben feels surprised, so it means that the expected outcome did not happen.
2. He expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, but he feels surprised, which indicates that something unexpected happened.
3. He thought that if the mixture produced a toxic gas, it would be safe since he can quickly evacuate and the lab has a proper ventilation system.
4. He also thought that if the mixture caused an explosion, it would be dangerous and could damage the lab and his equipment.
5. Since he is surprised, it means that neither a toxic gas was produced nor an explosion happened.

However, we cannot be sure which one of the two options is correct, because the passage does not provide enough information to determine whether a toxic gas was produced or not, or whether an explosion happened or not.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the information that is provided.

We know that Ben thought that if the mixture produced a toxic gas, it would be safe since he can quickly evacuate and the lab has a proper ventilation system. This suggests that he was prepared for the possibility of a toxic gas being produced.

Therefore, it is more likely that **option a** is correct, because it is more likely that Ben would be surprised if an explosion happened, since he did not take any precautions to protect himself from an explosion.

However, it is important to note that this is just a guess, and it is also possible that **option b** is correct.
