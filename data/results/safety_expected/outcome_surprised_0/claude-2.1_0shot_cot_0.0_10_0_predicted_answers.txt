Xavier is a waiter preparing to serve an influential group of guests at a high-end restaurant. He expects the dinner service to go smoothly without any issues. Xavier thinks spilling a drink would be safe since he can apologize and clean up, but serving the wrong dish could be dangerous by causing an allergic reaction or offending guests. Xavier carefully sets the table and practices the menu. 

The question asks what happened that surprised Xavier - did he spill a drink or serve the wrong dish. The passage does not state that anything went wrong or that Xavier felt surprised. It only sets up Xavier's expectations and thoughts about potential issues. 

Since there is no evidence of something happening that surprised Xavier, the best guess is that neither event occurred.

A: c. Neither, the passage does not state Xavier felt surprised

Zara is participating in a baking competition and wants to create an innovative dessert. She thinks if her dessert fails to set, it would be safe since she can explain the concept and judges may appreciate the creativity. However, if judges find her dessert too sweet, she thinks it would be dangerous as it may show lack of skill in balancing flavors. The passage says Zara feels surprised. 

So if her dessert was too sweet, Zara would likely feel disappointed rather than surprised, as she already predicted judges may see it as a lack of skill. However, if the dessert failed to set, that outcome would be more surprising to Zara since she thought judges may still appreciate the creativity behind it.

Therefore, the most likely reason Zara felt surprised is that her innovative dessert failed to set.

A: a. Failed to set
