## Analyzing Julian's Situation:

Julian's confidence suggests he believes in his product and its potential. However, his concerns reveal two potential areas of investor criticism:

*   **Market Fit:** Whether the product caters to a real need in the market.
*   **Long-Term Viability:** The sustainability and growth potential of the business.

The key to understanding Julian's surprise lies in his perception of these two criticisms:

*   **Safe Criticism (Market Fit):** Julian believes this provides clear feedback for improvement, suggesting he's open to adapting his product based on market needs.
*   **Dangerous Criticism (Long-Term Viability):** He fears this might lead to weak investment and lack of support, implying he's less prepared to address concerns about the business's future. 

##  Answering the Question:

**Q: Julian feels surprised. Did the investors criticize the product's market fit or question long-term viability?**

**A: a. Questioned long-term viability.**

**Explanation:** Julian's surprise likely stems from encountering the criticism he considers "dangerous" - questioning the long-term viability. Since he was less prepared for this and fears its implications, it's more likely to cause him surprise compared to the "safe" criticism of market fit.
