**Example:**

Zara, a passionate baker, is participating in a prestigious baking competition where she needs to create a new and innovative dessert. Zara expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received. Zara thinks that if her dessert fails to set, it would be safe since she can explain the innovative concept and the judges might appreciate her creativity. She thinks that if the judges find her dessert too sweet, it would be dangerous since it could be seen as a lack of skill and understanding of flavor balance. Zara starts baking her unique dessert creation. 

Q: Zara feels surprised. Did Zara's dessert fail to set or was it criticized for being too sweet? 
a. Failed to set 
b. Criticized for being too sweet 

Thought: Let's think step by step:

*   She believes a dessert not setting is "safe" as she can justify it with her innovative concept.
*   She considers a dessert being too sweet as "dangerous" due to potential negative perceptions of her skills.
*   The question states Zara feels surprised, implying the outcome she didn't expect occurred.
