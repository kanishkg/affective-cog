1. Identify the text that refers to Julian's perception of his pitch's safety.
2. Determine which option matches that perception.

a. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors questioned long-term viability and safe if they criticized the product's market fit.
b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors criticized the product's market fit and safe if they questioned long-term viability.

The relevant text states, "Julian expects the investors to challenge different parts of his pitch." This indicates that Julian anticipates criticism and has not considered the safety of his pitch. So, both options are incorrect.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the context. The investors sharply criticized the product's market fit and demanded substantial changes. This suggests that Julian may have considered this type of criticism to be more dangerous than questioning the long-term viability of the product.

**Therefore, the best guess from the options provided is:**

A: a. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors criticized the product's market fit and safe if they questioned long-term viability.

The question asks about Xavier's thought about the safety of the dinner service if he spilled a drink on a guest or served the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions. The passage does not provide specific information about Xavier's thoughts on these scenarios, so we cannot answer this question from the given context. However, we can make an educated guess based on common sense.

It is more likely that Xavier would consider it more dangerous to serve the wrong dish to a guest with dietary restrictions than to spill a drink on a guest. Serving the wrong dish could have serious consequences, such as causing the guest to have an allergic reaction or become ill. Spilling a drink on a guest is less likely to cause serious harm, although it could still be embarrassing or inconvenient.

Therefore, my best guess is that Xavier would think that it would be more dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest.

A: a. Xavier thought that it would be dangerous if he served the wrong dish and safe if he spilled a drink on a guest.

1. The passage doesn't contain any information about Zara's thoughts on the safety of her dessert.
2. I have to choose one of the options provided, even though neither of them is supported by the context.
3. Option 'a' states that Zara thought it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.
4. Option 'b' states that Zara thought it would be dangerous if her dessert was criticized for being too sweet and safe if it failed to set.
5. I will choose option 'a' because it is more logical to assume that Zara would be concerned about the safety of her dessert if it failed to set, as this could pose a health risk to the judges or audience.
A: a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.
