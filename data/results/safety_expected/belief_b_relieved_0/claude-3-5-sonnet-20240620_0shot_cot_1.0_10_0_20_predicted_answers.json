Penelope expects there might be some technical issues during the concert.\n4. During her performance, her guitar string actually breaks.\n5. The question states that Penelope feels relieved after this happens.\n6. If Penelope feels relieved, it suggests that she considered a broken guitar string to be a less serious issue compared to other potential problems.\n7. The question asks about her thoughts on safety regarding two potential issues: a broken guitar string and a malfunctioning sound system.\n8. Given that she feels relieved when the guitar string breaks, we can infer that she likely considered this to be a safer or less problematic issue.\n9.

When Penelope's guitar string actually breaks during her performance, she simply pauses the show.\n4. The question states that Penelope feels relieved after this incident.\n5. Feeling relieved suggests that the broken string was not seen as a major safety concern.\n6. A broken guitar string is a relatively minor issue that doesn't pose any real danger to anyone.\n7. On the other hand, a malfunctioning sound system could potentially be more dangerous, as it involves electrical equipment and could potentially cause issues like electric shocks or fires.\n8.

She expected the council to have concerns and questions about her design.\n3. The council expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the design.\n4. The question states that Rachel feels relieved after this.\n5. If Rachel feels relieved, it suggests that the concern raised (structural integrity) was not as serious as what she might have feared.\n6. This implies that Rachel would have been more worried if the council had questioned something else, like cost-effectiveness.\n7. Therefore, Rachel likely thought her design was structurally sound, but might have had concerns about its cost-effectiveness.\n8. The question asks what Rachel thought about the safety of her design based on what the council questioned.\n9. Option b aligns with this reasoning: Rachel would think it's dangerous if they questioned structural integrity (which they did, but she's relieved), and safe if they questioned cost-effectiveness (which they didn't, implying this was her bigger concern).\n\nA:b.
