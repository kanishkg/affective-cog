The question asks about Julian's feelings of safety regarding his pitch based on the investors' potential reactions. We need to analyze which type of criticism would make Julian feel his pitch was unsafe. 
*   Criticizing the product's market fit implies that the investors see flaws in how well the product aligns with the target market's needs and preferences. This is a critique of the core business idea.
*   Questioning long-term viability suggests concerns about the sustainability and potential for future success of the business. While still serious, it doesn't necessarily negate the core idea itself.

Therefore, Julian would likely feel his pitch was unsafe if the investors criticized the product's market fit, as it directly challenges the foundation of his business plan. 
A: b. Julian thought that it would be dangerous if the investors criticized the product's market fit and safe if they questioned long-term viability.

- The question asks about Zara's feelings regarding the safety of her dessert in two scenarios: failing to set and being criticized for excessive sweetness.
- Option 'a' suggests Zara would feel safe if criticized for sweetness but concerned about safety if the dessert didn't set. This aligns with potential concerns about the dessert's texture and edibility if it remains runny.
- Option 'b' suggests the opposite, with Zara worried about criticism but not the setting issue. This seems less likely as criticism is subjective, while a runny dessert could present objective safety concerns. 
A: a. Zara thought that it would be dangerous if her dessert failed to set and safe if it was criticized for being too sweet.
