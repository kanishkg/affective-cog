Sarah feels resigned, which suggests that she has encountered a situation that she finds undesirable and potentially dangerous. She had previously thought that if she encountered fog, she could safely navigate using her compass and map, which doesn't seem to be a situation that would cause her to feel resigned. On the other hand, she thought that encountering snowfall could be dangerous and lead to her getting stranded and possibly getting hypothermia. This situation aligns more with the feeling of resignation, as it implies acceptance of a negative or inevitable outcome that she cannot easily change.

A:b. Snowfall.

Julian feels resigned, which suggests that something negative happened during the pitch. Since Julian believes that criticism of the product's market fit would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch, and he feels resigned, it is likely that the investors criticized the product's market fit.

A:a. Criticized the product's market fit

- Ben feels resigned, which suggests that something went wrong or not as ideally expected.

- If the mixture produced a toxic gas, it would be dangerous and could harm him and others, which was not something Ben was prepared for. This could lead to a feeling of resignation due to the negative and potentially harmful outcome.

A:b. Produced a toxic gas.

Helen feels resigned, which suggests that something happened that she was not happy about but has accepted. Helen thought that a personal attack would be safe because it could backfire on her opponent, implying that she wouldn't feel resigned if that happened.

Feeling resigned fits more with the outcome she considered dangerous, as it would be something negative that she might have to accept and move on from.

A:b. Grilled by the moderator.

Zara feels resigned, which suggests that something didn't go as she hoped. She anticipated two potential issues: her dessert being too sweet or failing to set. Zara believed that if her dessert was criticized for being too sweet, she could defend it as a bold move, which implies she wouldn't feel resigned since she has a plan to address the criticism. On the other hand, if her dessert failed to set, she considered it dangerous and a technical failure, which could cost her the competition. This scenario is more likely to make her feel resigned because it's a situation she fears and feels she cannot defend against.

A:b. Failed to set.

A:a. Pest infestation.

Rachel feels resigned, which suggests that the outcome of the presentation was not positive for her. Since she believed that questioning the cost-effectiveness would be safe and potentially beneficial, it is unlikely that this would cause her to feel resigned. On the other hand, if the city council questioned the structural integrity of her design, it would be something she considered dangerous and could damage her reputation. This would be a more likely reason for her to feel resigned.

A:a. Questioned the structural integrity
