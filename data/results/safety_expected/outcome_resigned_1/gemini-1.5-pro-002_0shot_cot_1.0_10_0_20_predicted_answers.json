        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says that Sarah believes fog would be safe to navigate through, while snowfall could be dangerous, leading to being stranded and possibly getting hypothermia.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says that Sarah believes fog would be safe to navigate, while snowfall would be dangerous and could lead to hypothermia.  The question doesn't state anything about Sarah being in danger or having difficulty navigating, and being resigned isn't necessarily connected to a negative event.  It is possible that she feels resigned just from the challenge of the hike. Since the question doesn't give us explicit information about what she encountered, both are possible, though fog seems less likely to result in resignation, than snowfall would. However, there is no information in the passage to suggest that Sarah encountered either fog or snowfall.\n\nA:a. Fog.  Since we are only given options of fog or snowfall, and being resigned could stem from facing a difficult challenge like snowfall, I would choose snowfall if that was an option. However, of the options available, fog appears to be the least troublesome for Sarah and therefore the most likely to be encountered based on the information.\n",

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says that Sarah *expects* adverse weather, and *thinks* about what she would do *if* she encounters fog or snowfall.  It doesn't say that she actually encountered either.  Since the question asks what happened to make her feel resigned, and the passage doesn't say anything about her feeling resigned, the best answer is that neither event has happened yet. The question is a bit of a trick.\n\nA:b. Snowfall. It is not mentioned in the passage whether Sarah encountered fog or snowfall.  Since neither is mentioned as happening, the information about snowfall being more dangerous seems irrelevant to the question. However, since the question implies that something must have happened to make her feel resigned, and snowfall is mentioned as being the more serious of the two possible weather events, it might be the best guess.\n",

The question asks about Zachary feeling resigned, but the story doesn't explicitly state his feelings after the show. However, it implies that he would be more concerned, not resigned, if a model tripped. Mixed reviews, while not ideal, are something he considers \"safe\" and a potential learning opportunity.  Therefore, it's more likely he'd feel resigned about mixed reviews than a model tripping.\n\nA:b. Collection received mixed reviews\n",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nZachary believes that mixed reviews would be a safe outcome, while a model tripping would be dangerous and memorable for the wrong reasons.  The question implies something happened that caused Zachary to feel resigned.

Model tripped on the runway\n",

The question asks what Charles *experienced*. Since he has *experienced* neither, it is unlikely that he feels resigned.  The passage implies that Charles thinks he can manage a drought and is prepared to do so.  It seems that a pest infestation would be a worse problem for him than a drought.
