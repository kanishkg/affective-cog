        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage says Helen *expects* challenging moments, such as getting grilled by the moderator or a personal attack from her opponent.  It doesn't say that either of these things actually happened.  The question asks what happened to make Helen feel resigned, but the passage doesn't say she felt resigned.  Since the passage doesn't say either event happened, neither option is supported by the text.\n\nA:a. Grilled by the moderator. Neither event is described as happening in the text.  Since the question presupposes that one of these events *did* happen, I'm guessing, but the question can't be answered from the given text.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Charles *expects* challenges, including drought and pests.  It doesn't say either of these things actually happened.  Since the question asks what Charles *experienced*, and neither a drought nor pest infestation is stated as having happened, neither option is correct based on the information given. However, we are asked to choose from the options provided. The question asks about Charles feeling resigned. The passage says if there's a drought, Charles can employ water-saving techniques, so he wouldn't feel resigned. If there's a pest infestation, it would be difficult to manage, so he might feel resigned.\n\nA:a. Pest infestation\n"
