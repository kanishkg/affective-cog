The story mentions that Xavier thinks:\n   - Serving the wrong dish would be \"safe\" because he can quickly replace it and apologize.\n   - Spilling a drink would be \"dangerous\" because it could damage clothing and make a terrible impression.\n\n4. Xavier feeling resigned suggests that something negative has happened, but not necessarily catastrophic.\n\n5. If Xavier had spilled a drink, which he considers \"dangerous,\" he would likely feel more than just resigned - he might feel panicked or extremely upset.\n\n6. Serving the wrong dish, which Xavier considers \"safe,\" is more likely to result in a feeling of resignation. It's a mistake, but one that can be corrected without major consequences.\n\n7.
