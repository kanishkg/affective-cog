Sarah is a solo hiker navigating a challenging mountain trail. She expects some adverse weather events. If there's fog, she can safely navigate using her compass and map. If there's snowfall, it could be dangerous and she could get stranded or hypothermic. The question asks what weather event made Sarah feel resigned - either fog or snowfall. 

Since fog would not make her feel resigned or worried according to the passage, it must have been snowfall. Snowfall could leave her stranded or with hypothermia which would make her feel resigned about the situation.

A: a. Snowfall

The passage says that if investors question long-term viability, Julian thinks that would be a safe indicator of a future partnership. However, if investors criticize the product's market fit, that would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch. After Julian's pitch, the passage says he feels resigned. Since he would feel positive about questions on long-term viability but negative if they criticized market fit, his resigned feeling suggests the investors criticized the product's market fit.

A: b. Criticized the product's market fit

- Ben is conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound with potential medical applications
- He expects there may be some unexpected outcomes from the experiment
- If the mixture causes a small, contained explosion, Ben thinks it would be safe due to his safety measures
- If the mixture produces a toxic gas, Ben thinks it would be dangerous and could harm him and others
- After mixing the chemicals, Ben feels resigned
- If there was just a small explosion, Ben likely wouldn't feel resigned since he prepared safety measures for that
- If there was a toxic gas produced, he would feel resigned and worried about the danger from the gas

A: a. Produced a toxic gas

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Helen is preparing for a mayoral debate against her opponent
- She thinks a personal attack from her opponent would be safe, as it could backfire on them
- But getting grilled by the moderator would be dangerous, as it could hurt her credibility
- The question asks what happened that made Helen feel resigned
- If she got grilled by the moderator, that could have exposed weaknesses and hurt her credibility, making her feel resigned
- A personal attack from her opponent would likely not make her feel resigned

A: b. Grilled by the moderator

I reasoned that since getting grilled by the moderator would be more likely to hurt Helen's credibility and make her feel resigned, while a personal attack may backfire on her opponent, the best guess is that she got grilled by the moderator.

Penelope is a talented musician preparing for her first live concert after months of practice. She expects some technical issues might happen during the concert. If the sound system malfunctions, she thinks it would be safe since the technical team can fix it promptly. However, if her guitar string breaks, it would be dangerous and could cause her to lose confidence on stage. 

The question asks what issue did Penelope experience if she feels resigned. Feeling resigned implies she has lost some confidence. Penelope thought a broken guitar string would be dangerous and cause her to lose confidence. Therefore, if she feels resigned, the most likely issue is:

A: a. Broken guitar string

Xavier is a waiter preparing to serve an influential group of guests. He expects there may be some issues and considers serving the wrong dish as safe since he can quickly replace it, but spilling a drink as dangerous since it could damage clothing and make a bad impression. Xavier carefully prepares for the dinner service. 

The question asks what happened if Xavier feels resigned. Resigned means accepting something undesirable as inevitable. So if Xavier feels resigned, it likely means something bad happened that he couldn't fix, rather than something safe that he could fix. Spilling a drink would be hard to recover from, while serving the wrong dish he could fix.

So if Xavier feels resigned, the best guess is that he spilled a drink on a guest rather than served the wrong dish.

A: b. Spilled a drink on a guest

Zara was participating in a baking competition and made an innovative dessert. She thought there might be some issues - if it was criticized for being too sweet, that would be safe as she could defend it as a bold move. However, if it failed to set, that would be dangerous and could cost her the competition. 
The question asks what happened if Zara feels resigned. If her dessert was criticized for being too sweet, Zara thought she could defend that. But if it failed to set, she thought that would be a technical failure and dangerous to her chances. 
So if Zara feels resigned, it suggests her dessert likely failed to set rather than just being criticized for sweetness.

A: a. Failed to set

Zachary was preparing to showcase his latest fashion collection at a prestigious fashion show. He expected there might be some minor issues, like his collection receiving mixed reviews or a model tripping on the runway. Zachary felt mixed reviews would be safe since it could lead to improvements, but a model tripping would be dangerous and overshadow his collection. After Zachary presented his designs on the runway, it says he feels resigned. 

So if Zachary feels resigned after the fashion show, it likely means the dangerous situation he feared happened - a model tripped on the runway. This would explain him feeling disappointed or resigned.

A: b. Model tripped on the runway

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Charles planted a new crop variety and expected some challenges during the growing season
- If there was a drought, Charles felt it would be safe since he could use water-saving techniques and irrigation 
- If there was a pest infestation, Charles felt it would be dangerous since it could spread and be hard to manage
- The passage says Charles feels resigned, meaning he has accepted an undesirable situation
- Charles thought a pest infestation would be dangerous, while a drought could be managed more easily

A: a. Pest infestation

I chose a. Pest infestation because the passage suggests Charles would feel more resigned/accepting of an undesirable situation if his crops were affected by the more dangerous pest infestation rather than something like drought that he felt could be managed.

Rachel presented her bridge design to the city council. She expected they may question the cost-effectiveness or structural integrity. She felt questioning the cost-effectiveness would be safe as it could lead to optimizing resources and a better solution. However, questioning the structural integrity would be dangerous as it could damage her reputation as a reliable engineer. After presenting, Rachel feels resigned. This suggests the city council likely questioned the structural integrity rather than just the cost-effectiveness.

A: b. Questioned the structural integrity
