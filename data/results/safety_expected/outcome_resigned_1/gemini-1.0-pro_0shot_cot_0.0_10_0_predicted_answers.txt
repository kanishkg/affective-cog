1. Penelope expects that there might be some technical issues during the concert.
2. Penelope thinks that if the sound system malfunctions, it would be safe since the technical team can fix it promptly.
3. Penelope thinks that if her guitar string breaks, it would be dangerous and could cause her to lose her confidence on stage.
4. Penelope begins her performance on stage.
5. We cannot know for sure if Penelope experienced a broken guitar string or a sound system malfunction because the text does not provide information about what technical issue she experienced.

Since we cannot know for sure which technical issue Penelope experienced, we can guess based on the information provided in the text. The text states that Penelope thinks that if her guitar string breaks, it would be dangerous and could cause her to lose her confidence on stage. This suggests that Penelope is more concerned about her guitar string breaking than she is about the sound system malfunctioning. Therefore, it is more likely that Penelope experienced a broken guitar string.

- The story mentions that Rachel prepares herself for concerns about the cost-effectiveness and structural integrity of her bridge design before presenting it to the city council.
- The story does not mention any specific questions or concerns raised by the city council during the presentation.
- However, the story does mention that Rachel feels resigned after the presentation. This suggests that the city council may have raised concerns that she was not prepared for.
- Out of the two options given, questioning the structural integrity is a more serious concern than questioning the cost-effectiveness. This is because structural integrity is essential for the safety of the bridge, whereas cost-effectiveness is more of a financial concern.
- It is more likely that the city council would raise concerns about the structural integrity of the design, which would make Rachel feel resigned.

A: a. Questioned the structural integrity
