 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this story and choose the best answer:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Julian is an entrepreneur pitching his startup to investors
- He is very confident in his pitch and does not expect any challenges or questions
- He thinks if investors question long-term viability, it indicates a future partnership
- He thinks if they criticize market fit, it could collapse the pitch and miss the opportunity
- The investors sharply criticize the market fit and demand changes
- This goes against what Julian was expecting and hoping for

A: b. devastated

Julian likely feels devastated because the investors criticized the very thing he thought could lead to a collapsed pitch and missed opportunity. This goes against his confidence and expectations, so he is likely devastated at the sharp criticism.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ben is a scientist conducting an experiment to create a new chemical compound 
- He expects the experiment to go smoothly without any issues
- He thinks a small, contained explosion would be safe due to his safety measures
- He thinks producing a toxic gas would be dangerous and could harm people
- The mixture produced a toxic gas, forcing Ben to evacuate
- This goes against Ben's hypothesis and expectations that things would go smoothly

A: b. surprised

I chose "surprised" because Ben did not expect his experiment to produce dangerous toxic gas since he expected things to go smoothly. So he would likely feel surprised when things did not happen as he hypothesized.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Rachel is an engineer presenting her bridge design to the city council
