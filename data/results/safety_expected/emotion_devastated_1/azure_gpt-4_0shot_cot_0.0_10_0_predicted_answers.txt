Sarah expects the weather to be pleasant, which means she does not anticipate bad weather conditions. When she encounters snowfall, it is something she did not expect and it could be dangerous for her. She could feel surprised because it was not what she was expecting. She could also feel resigned because she might accept the situation as it is and deal with it. However, since she thought snowfall could be dangerous, it is less likely that she feels relieved because snowfall poses a threat to her safety. Devastated might be too strong a word for encountering snowfall, but it could be possible if she feels that the snowfall severely threatens her hike or safety. Between surprised and resigned, surprised seems more fitting because it aligns with encountering an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation.

A:b. surprised.

Julian is confident that his pitch covers everything and does not expect any challenges or questions.
He believes that questions about long-term viability would indicate a potential partnership.
However, he also thinks that criticism of the product's market fit would be dangerous and could collapse the pitch.
The investors criticize the product's market fit, which is the scenario Julian feared.
Given Julian's thoughts on criticism of market fit leading to a collapsed pitch, he would likely feel negative emotions.

A:d. devastated. Julian likely feels devastated because the investors' criticism aligns with the scenario he thought would be dangerous and could lead to a missed opportunity.

Ben expected the experiment to go smoothly without any issues, which implies he did not anticipate any negative outcomes.
The production of toxic gas was not what Ben expected, as he considered it dangerous and a scenario that could harm him and others.
Since the toxic gas was not part of the expected outcome, and it forced him to evacuate the lab, it is likely that Ben would be surprised by this turn of events.
The options resigned, relieved, and devastated do not directly relate to the unexpected outcome of the experiment, as resigned would imply acceptance of an expected negative outcome, relieved would suggest a positive resolution to a feared situation, and devastated would imply a catastrophic outcome, which is not indicated by the information provided.

A:a. surprised.

Helen was preparing for the debate and expected it to go smoothly, which implies she was confident about her performance.
She considered a personal attack from her opponent to be safe, suggesting she was not worried about that possibility.
However, she thought getting grilled by the moderator would be dangerous as it could expose weaknesses and hurt her credibility.
During the debate, Helen gets grilled by the moderator and struggles to respond effectively, which is the scenario she feared.
Given that the situation she considered dangerous has occurred, and she struggled, it is unlikely she feels relieved or resigned, as these do not align with the concern she had about being grilled.
Between surprised and devastated, devastated is more likely because it aligns with the negative outcome of a situation she was worried about and her struggle to respond effectively.

A:c. devastated.

Penelope was preparing for her concert and expected it to go smoothly, which implies she was hoping for no issues. She considered a sound system malfunction to be safe because it could be fixed quickly, but she thought a broken guitar string would be dangerous and could cause her to lose confidence. Since the guitar string actually breaks during her performance, it's an event she feared and thought would be dangerous. Therefore, she is likely to feel negatively about this incident.

Xavier was preparing for the dinner service and expected it to go smoothly. He considered the possibility of serving the wrong dish as safe because it could be quickly corrected. However, he thought spilling a drink on a guest would be dangerous as it could damage clothing and make a terrible impression. Since the scenario ends with Xavier accidentally spilling a drink on a guest, which is the situation he wanted to avoid, he is likely to feel negative emotions rather than relief or resignation. Between 'surprised' and 'devastated,' the latter would be more intense and fitting given that he was serving influential guests and had taken precautions to avoid such incidents.

A:d. devastated.

Zara is passionate about baking and is participating in a prestigious competition, which indicates that she has high expectations for her performance. She expects her dessert to be perfect and well-received, showing that she cares deeply about the outcome. Zara has considered the potential criticisms and has prepared a defense for her dessert being too sweet, but she has identified that if her dessert fails to set, it would be seen as a technical failure. This suggests that she understands the gravity of such a mistake in the context of the competition. When her dessert fails to set, it is a realization of her concern, which would likely lead to a strong negative emotion because it's a critical error that she feared could cost her the competition.

A:a. devastated. Zara likely feels devastated because her dessert, which she expected to be perfect, has failed in a way that she considered dangerous and potentially competition-ending.

- Zachary expects the fashion show to go smoothly without any issues, which means he is hopeful for a positive outcome.
- He thinks that if a model trips, it would be dangerous since it could overshadow his collection and make the event memorable for the wrong reasons.

- Charles is preparing for the harvest season and is planting a new crop variety.
- He expects the growing season to go smoothly without any issues.
- Charles has considered two potential problems: drought and pests.
- He believes that if the crop is affected by drought, it would be safe because he has water-saving techniques and irrigation.
- However, he thinks that if the crop is infested with pests, it would be dangerous and difficult to manage.
- Charles discovers that the crop is indeed infested with pests, which is the scenario he feared would be dangerous.
- Given that pest infestation was the scenario he wanted to avoid and he considers it dangerous, it is unlikely that he feels relieved or surprised since he had already considered the possibility.
- It is more likely that he feels negative emotions due to the pest infestation.
- Between 'devastated' and 'resigned,' 'devastated' would imply a strong negative reaction to the situation, which fits the context since he was worried about this specific problem.

Rachel expects the city council to approve her design without any issues, which implies she is confident in her design. However, she also anticipates potential questions about cost-effectiveness or structural integrity. She believes that questions about cost-effectiveness would be safe, but questions about structural integrity would be dangerous as it could harm her reputation. Since the city council expresses concerns about the structural integrity, this is the scenario Rachel thought would be dangerous. It is likely that Rachel feels negatively about this outcome because it challenges her reputation as a reliable engineer.
