Both outcomes were anticipated and desired by Eliza.

Since she's excited about the experience, it indicates an interest in the play itself.

Given this information, we cannot conclusively determine her primary goal. After watching the play, Eliza enjoyed it but did not meet any of the actors. The question then states that she feels disappointed, which indicates that her expectations were not met.
