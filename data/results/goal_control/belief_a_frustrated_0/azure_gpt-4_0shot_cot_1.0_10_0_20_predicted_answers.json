        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy applied to Stanford hoping to be admitted, which indicates a desire and some level of belief that there's a chance for a positive outcome.\n2. However, college admissions, especially for schools like Stanford and Harvard, are highly competitive and unpredictable. Most students are aware of the uncertainty involved in the process.\n3. Amy also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, which suggests she might be going through the motions at least for Harvard, possibly indicating that she knows she doesn't have full control over the admissions process.\n4. Feeling frustrated about being rejected from Stanford might reflect her disappointment that despite her hopes or actions, the outcome was not in her control.\n\nBased on these points, Amy might have hoped to influence the outcome positively by preparing a good application, but deep down she likely knew that many factors beyond her control would be at play in the admissions decision.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applying to college, especially to her dream school Stanford, and to Harvard to make her parents happy, suggests she was engaged in the process and hoped for a positive outcome. However, her frustration at being accepted into Harvard but rejected from Stanford indicates she likely realized that the admissions process was out of her control, as she did not get the result she truly wanted. The feeling of frustration often comes when an outcome is contrary to one's wishes or efforts, suggesting a belief that there was a possibility of influencing the result, yet the ultimate decision was not hers to make.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy's emotions, particularly feeling frustrated upon her rejection from Stanford, suggests that she had some level of expectation or hope about the result.\n- However, it is common knowledge that college admissions, especially to highly competitive schools like Stanford and Harvard, are not entirely within an applicant's control. Many factors are at play, including the pool of applicants, the subjective nature of admissions decisions, and the limited number of spots available.\n- Therefore, while Amy may have hoped to be admitted and possibly believed she had a chance, it is unlikely that she thought she could control the outcome fully. Her frustration is more likely due to disappointment in not achieving her desired outcome rather than a belief that she could control it.\n- There is no information in the story that explicitly states Amy believed she could control the outcome.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy applies to both Stanford and Harvard, indicating she is taking the necessary steps in the college application process, which requires a degree of effort and hope.\n- Her desire to attend Stanford and the effort to apply suggests she believes her actions can influence the admissions outcome to some extent.\n- However, Amy ends up being rejected from Stanford and accepted to Harvard, which contrasts with her desires and preferences.\n- The fact that she feels frustrated after being rejected from Stanford suggests that the outcome was not what she had hoped for or anticipated. This frustration can imply that she believed she had some influence or control over being admitted, and the result contradicts her belief.\n\nA: a. Amy thought she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy's feeling of frustration upon being rejected from Stanford and accepted to Harvard suggests that the outcome was not what she desired or expected.\n- If Amy believed she could control the admissions outcome, she would likely have taken steps to ensure acceptance to Stanford, her preferred college, and possibly rejection from Harvard, which she dislikes.\n- The fact that she applied to Harvard \"to appease her parents\" indicates that she was doing it out of obligation rather than confidence that it would lead to her desired outcome.\n- The outcome\u2014rejection from Stanford and acceptance to Harvard\u2014was contrary to her hopes, which is likely the source of her frustration.\n- This frustration implies that while she might have hoped for a specific result, the actual outcome was not within her control, as it did not align with her desires.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy hopes to get into Stanford, which suggests she is optimistic about her chances, but hope does not necessarily mean she believes she has control over the outcome.\n- Applying to college is typically seen as a process with an uncertain outcome, with most students understanding that acceptance is not guaranteed.\n- Amy's feeling of frustration at being rejected from Stanford could imply that she had some expectation of being admitted, but it does not provide clear evidence that she believed she could control the admissions process.\n- The fact that she also applied to Harvard, even though she dislikes it, could indicate that she understands the competitive nature of college admissions and that she needs to have backup options, acknowledging that she does not have full control over the decisions made by the admission offices.\n\nA: a.

The feeling of frustration at the outcome suggests that Amy might have had some expectation regarding the results of her applications.\n3. However, the fact that she's frustrated does not necessarily imply she believed she could control the admissions process. College admissions, especially at elite schools like Stanford and Harvard, are known to be highly competitive and somewhat unpredictable.\n4. If Amy believed she could control the outcome, she might not feel frustration in the same way, because she would feel responsible for the result.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Amy probably understood that she did not have control over the college admissions decisions.\n\nA: a.

Amy feeling frustrated upon rejection suggests that the outcome was against her wishes or expectations.\n4. The mere act of applying to colleges does not tell us whether Amy believed she could control the admissions outcome. It only indicates she participated in the process.\n\nThe story does not directly state whether Amy believed she could control the outcome. However, the feeling of frustration might imply that she had some hope or expectation of being accepted, which in turn could suggest a belief in at least some degree of influence over the outcome. Yet, frustration alone does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Amy thought she had control over the admissions decision.\n\nA:a.

Her hope of being admitted to Stanford suggests she had some level of optimism about her chances, which may imply a belief in the possibility of influencing the outcome.\n3. However, the fact that Amy feels frustrated after getting rejected from Stanford implies she may have expected a positive result or at least believed her actions could sway the admissions decision.\n4. If she truly believed she had no control over the admissions outcome, her frustration might be less about the rejection itself and more about the uncontrollable nature of the situation.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Amy might have had some belief that she could influence the admissions outcome by submitting a strong application and possibly fulfilling other criteria that universities look for, which led to her frustration upon rejection.\n\nA:a.

College admissions, especially for prestigious institutions like Stanford and Harvard, are known to be highly competitive and often unpredictable.\n- Amy's frustration at being rejected by Stanford might reflect disappointment rather than a belief that she could control the admissions process.\n\nA: b.

This disappointment could stem from the belief that she had some control over the outcome, which was contradicted by the rejection.\n- However, Amy's decision to apply to Harvard despite disliking it, to appease her parents, hints that she might understand the admissions process is not entirely within her control. She's taking a step she wouldn't otherwise take for an added chance at success, implying a recognition of the process's unpredictability.\n\nBased on these points, while Amy likely believed she could influence the outcome by applying and presenting her best self, the frustration at being rejected suggests that she also recognized the limits of her control. She was aware of the competitive and unpredictable nature of college admissions.
