        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from University teams.\n2. He specifically invited coaches from university baseball teams to watch him play.\n3. Johnny also invited coaches from Minor League teams, even though he didn't want to play in the Minor Leagues.\n4.
