Okay, I can help you answer questions based on stories and provide reasoning for my choices. 

**Example:**

**Story:** Amy, a high school student applying to college, wants to go to Stanford and hopes she is admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend. Amy completes and submits her college applications. Amy gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford.

**Q: Amy feels frustrated. Did Amy believe she could control the outcome of her college admissions?**

a. Amy thought she could control the outcome of her college admissions 
b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions 

**Thought: Let's think step by step:**

*   If Amy believed she had complete control over the admissions process, she would likely feel confident rather than hopeful.
*   Her frustration at the outcome suggests she had an expectation that was not met, again pointing to a lack of control. 

**A: b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions**
