        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe fact that Amy feels grateful suggests that the outcome was positive but not guaranteed. Gratitude typically arises from receiving something good that one could not necessarily be sure of obtaining. If Amy believed she could control the outcome, her reaction might be more along the lines of satisfaction or pride, rather than gratitude. Therefore, it's more likely that she did not think she could control the outcome, since control would mitigate the sense of gratitude for the outcome.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy's feelings of gratitude upon being accepted to Stanford suggest that she may have been uncertain about the outcome. People typically feel grateful when something good happens that they weren't entirely sure would occur. If Amy were certain she could control the admissions outcome, her feelings might lean more towards satisfaction or vindication rather than gratitude. However, the feeling of gratitude alone does not definitively indicate that she did not believe she could control the outcome; she could simply be thankful that her efforts paid off. Since there is no information provided that directly states Amy's beliefs about controlling the admissions outcome, we can only infer from the context given. Because Amy also applied to Harvard (even though she did not want to go there) to appease her parents, it further suggests that she was trying to maximize her chances rather than being confident of controlling the admissions process. Therefore, it seems more likely that Amy did not believe she could control the outcome of her college admissions.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Feeling grateful generally implies that the outcome was at least somewhat uncertain and that there was a positive result that one hoped for but did not entirely expect or control.\n- If Amy believed she could control the college admissions outcome, she might feel satisfied or vindicated rather than grateful, because the outcome would have been expected and a direct result of her actions.\n- Since Amy feels grateful, it's more likely that she did not think she could control the outcome completely, but rather hoped for the best result.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy applied to both Stanford and Harvard. If she had a strong belief in controlling the outcome, she might not have applied to Harvard, especially given her dislike for the institution.\n- Applying to more than one college is often a strategy to manage the unpredictability of college admissions. Therefore, applying to both could imply that she understood there was an element of uncertainty in the process.\n- Feeling grateful upon acceptance suggests that there was something unexpected about the outcome. Gratitude often accompanies situations where the outcome could have been different and was not solely in the individual's control.\n- The story does not provide explicit evidence of Amy's belief in her ability to control admissions; however, the context suggests a recognition of the process's competitive and uncertain nature.\n\nA:a.

If Amy had believed she could control the outcome of her college admissions, she might have felt satisfied or proud, but gratitude might not be the primary emotion since that would imply a sense of control. Since Amy feels grateful upon her acceptance to Stanford, it suggests that there was some level of uncertainty, and she did not think she could fully control the outcome.

However, the statement does not mention that he believed attending the group fitness class would also control how many friends he makes.

This indicates that he believes attending these classes would help him control or contribute to his physical fitness improvement.\n2. While Ivan wants to make new friends, it is mentioned that he is less concerned about this aspect. Despite this, choosing to attend group fitness classes could indicate that he thought it might be a way to meet new people, thus having some control over making friends.\n3. Even if Ivan did not make friends, the fact that he is grateful suggests that he achieved his primary goal of improving his physical fitness.\n\nFrom this analysis, it seems more likely that Ivan believed he could exert control over both his physical fitness and making friends by attending group fitness classes. However, since the question also asks for what he believed, and Ivan did not make friends, it is also possible that he recognized some element of chance or external factors in making friends. The information does not definitively say he believed making friends was within his control, especially since he is less concerned about it, but it does imply he thought he had control over his fitness.\n\nA:a.

Since the story does not provide explicit information about Ivan's beliefs regarding his control over making friends, we can only infer from his actions and priorities.
