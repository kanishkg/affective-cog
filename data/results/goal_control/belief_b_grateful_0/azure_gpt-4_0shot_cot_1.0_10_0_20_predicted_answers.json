His belief that his chances of receiving an offer are outside his control indicates that he might feel that the outcome is not just based on his performance but could also be influenced by other factors such as scouts' perceptions or team needs.\nDespite this belief, he takes the proactive step of inviting coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams, indicating he is interested in opportunities from both types of organizations.\nAfter the conference finals, Johnny receives multiple offers from universities but none from Minor League teams. Despite this, the question states that Johnny feels grateful, which implies he is pleased with the outcome.\nIf Johnny had solely wanted to play with a Minor League team, he might have felt disappointed instead of grateful, considering he received no offers from those teams. Since he is grateful, this suggests that the offers he did receive align with his aspirations or at least present a satisfying alternative.\n\nA:b. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from University teams, so he could train in college and have a chance of getting drafted to the MLB. He did not want to play in the Minor Leagues."
