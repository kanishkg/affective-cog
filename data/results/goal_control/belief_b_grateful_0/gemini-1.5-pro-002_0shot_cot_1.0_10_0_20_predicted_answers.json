However, the question asks what Ben *wanted* to work with. The passage mentions Ben believes client acquisition is \"beyond his control.\"  This suggests Ben is open to various clients but recognizes limitations in attracting certain types. Therefore, the option indicating Ben desires high-profile clients for better opportunities aligns better with the goal of increasing his client base and improving his career prospects.\n\nA:b.

The question also mentions Ben being grateful, likely meaning grateful for the local clients. This is compatible with him *not* being satisfied with just local clients and originally desiring high-profile clients.\n\nA:b.

However, his *primary goal* is what he *wants*, regardless of what he believes. The passage says he *wants* to improve his fitness *and* make friends.  However, the question asks for the *primary* goal and provides two options that prioritize one over the other. Since the passage doesn't indicate one is more important to him than the other, we can't definitively say which is primary. Since we must choose an option, 'a' seems slightly better as it aligns with the first goal mentioned. It also aligns slightly better with the outcome where he improved his fitness but didn't make friends. However, it's important to note this is an assumption based on limited information.\n\nA:a.
