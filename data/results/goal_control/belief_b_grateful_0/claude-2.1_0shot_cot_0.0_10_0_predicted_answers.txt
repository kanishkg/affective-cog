The story summarizes that Amy is a high school student who applied to both Stanford and Harvard for college. She believed she could not control the outcome of her admissions. She was accepted to Stanford but rejected from Harvard. When she found out, she felt grateful.

To figure out what Amy wanted, we need to consider her reaction to the admissions decisions. Since she felt grateful when accepted to Stanford, this suggests she was happy with that outcome. Therefore, she likely wanted to attend Stanford rather than Harvard.

A:a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.

Johnny is a high school student on the baseball team preparing for the conference finals. He invited university and minor league coaches to watch him play, hoping to get offers. He received multiple university offers but no minor league offers. 

The question asks what kind of teams Johnny wished to receive offers from. The passage says Johnny invited both university and minor league coaches, so he was hoping for offers from both. But he only got university offers. So his goal was to play for a minor league team affiliated with the MLB rather than go to university.

A: a. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from the Minor Leagues, so he could train and play with an MLB-affiliated team. He did not wish to play university baseball.

Emma recently graduated from college and was looking for a job. She applied to various jobs, including some in the city. However, she was only able to find a job in her small hometown and not in the city she had applied to. When this happened, the passage states that "Emma feels grateful." 

Based on this, it seems Emma wanted to stay in her hometown near her family and friends, rather than move to the unfamiliar big city. If she had wanted to move to the city for better opportunities, she probably wouldn't have felt grateful when she could only find a job in her hometown.

A: a. Emma wanted to stay in her hometown because she values her close relationships with family and friends. She did not want to move to the big city because she fears losing those connections.

The passage states that Ben "does not find high-profile clients" after creating his online portfolio. This suggests that Ben wanted to work with high-profile clients, but was unable to attract them as customers initially. Therefore, the best answer is that Ben wanted high-profile clients but ended up only getting local, small business clients.

A: a. Ben wanted to work with high-profile clients because he believes it will provide him with better career opportunities and financial stability. He does not want to work with local clients because he fears stagnation.

Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness. The passage states that Ivan "wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends." However, it also says that Ivan "believes that his physical fitness improvement and making friends are outside of his control." This suggests that while both goals were important to Ivan, improving fitness was likely the primary one since he felt it was outside of his control. The passage later confirms that Ivan did improve his physical fitness by attending the group fitness class, meeting that primary goal. Making friends is presented more as a secondary desirable outcome.

A: b. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym

A: a. Max prioritized finding a unique outfit that would make a statement, even if it was expensive.

Ethan landed the leading role in the play, so he must have wanted the leading role. The passage says Ethan believes the role he gets will be determined by the casting directors' preferences, not his own. But he ends up grateful when he lands the leading role.

- Eliza believes that enjoying the play and meeting the actors are outside of her control. This suggests she went in with no expectations.
- At the end, Eliza feels grateful. This implies that she got something positive out of the experience, even without meeting any actors.
- If her primary goal was to meet the actors, she likely would have felt disappointed rather than grateful when that did not happen.

A: a. Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production, and she believed that the local theater has a good reputation for putting on great shows. She was less concerned about meeting the actors.

My reasoning is that since Eliza felt grateful after enjoying the play but not meeting any actors, her main priority was likely to see and appreciate the theater production itself. Meeting actors seems like a secondary goal for her based on her reaction. Her feeling of gratitude stems from the play exceeding her initial expectation, suggesting the play itself was her primary motivation for attending.

Rachel's primary goal was to attend a special exhibition featuring her favorite artist at the museum. She believed her experience would depend on factors like the quality of the tour and people she meets.

A: b. Rachel's primary goal was to learn more about her favorite artist's work, and she believed attending the guided tour would help her achieve this. She was less concerned about making friends at the museum.
