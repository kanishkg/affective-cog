- The fact that Amy feels grateful suggests that the outcome (being admitted to Stanford) is pleasing to her.
- There is no information provided that Amy wanted to be closer to home, so we cannot assume that as a reason for her preference.

- Johnny is a high school student preparing for the conference finals, which indicates he is serious about his baseball career.
- He believes his chances of receiving an offer are outside his control, suggesting he is hoping for something to happen rather than expecting it.
- Johnny invites coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams, showing he is interested in opportunities from both types of organizations.

- Emma is looking for a job and believes her future is uncertain.
- The location of her job is outside of her control, which suggests she is open to different possibilities.
- Emma applies to various jobs, indicating she is exploring different opportunities.
- Emma finds a job in her hometown and cannot find one in the city.

Therefore, we can only guess based on the information given.

A: a. Emma wanted to stay in her hometown because she values her close relationships with family and friends. She did not want to move to the big city because she fears losing those connections.
