        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nJohnny invited both university and Minor League baseball teams to watch him play. He received offers from multiple universities but none from the Minor Leagues.  The question asks what kind of teams Johnny *wished* to receive offers from.  Since he invited both types, it's likely he desired offers from both. However, the fact that he received university offers and feels grateful suggests he is happy with those offers.
