Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production.\n2. She believed the local theater had a good reputation for putting on great shows.\n3. She was less concerned about meeting the actors.\n4. Eliza enjoyed the play, which aligned with her primary goal.\n5. She did not have the opportunity to meet any actors, but this was not her main concern.\n6. The question states that Eliza feels joyful, suggesting her primary goal was met.\n7. Eliza's enjoyment of the play seems to be based on the quality of the production, not on her own actions.\n8. The opportunity to meet actors appears to be something outside of her control, as it's not mentioned that she took any specific actions to make this happen.\n9. Eliza's focus was on the play itself, and she was less concerned about meeting actors.\n10. This suggests she understood that her enjoyment would largely depend on the quality of the production, not her own actions.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\nA:a. Eliza believed that her enjoyment of the play and the chance to meet the actors are outside of her control.",

The enjoyment of a play is largely subjective and depends on the quality of the production and personal taste, which are not entirely within one's control.\n8. Meeting actors after a show is often a matter of chance or opportunity, which is also not entirely within one's control.\n9. Eliza's belief in the theater's reputation suggests she trusted in the quality of the show rather than believing she could control her enjoyment.\n\nGiven these points, it appears that Eliza understood that her enjoyment and the chance to meet actors were not entirely within her control. She focused on attending the play with positive expectations but without the belief that she could directly control these outcomes.\n\nA:b.
