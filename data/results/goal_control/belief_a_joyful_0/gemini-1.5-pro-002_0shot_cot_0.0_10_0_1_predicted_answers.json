        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEliza's primary goal was to enjoy the play.  She believed the theater had a good reputation, implying she thought it likely she *would* enjoy it. This suggests she believed she had some control over her enjoyment by choosing to attend this particular theater.  However, she was *less* concerned with meeting the actors. This downplays the idea that she felt in control of that aspect.  While she might have hoped to meet them, it wasn't a primary goal, and the passage doesn't say she took any action to make it happen.\n\nA:b. Eliza believed that by attending the play and staying afterwards, she could control her enjoyment of the play and the likelihood of meeting the actors.\n"

She achieved her goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the artist's work. This suggests she believed she could control the aspect of her experience related to learning about the art by taking specific actions (attending the tour).
