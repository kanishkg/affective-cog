- Amy applied to Stanford because she really wanted to go there. This suggests she hoped she would get in, but did not necessarily think she could control the outcome. 
- Amy also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, even though she did not want to go there. This further suggests she knew she could not control whether she got into Harvard.
- The passage states that Amy "hopes" she gets into Stanford, implying she could not control the outcome.

Therefore, the evidence suggests Amy did not think she could fully control whether she was admitted to the colleges. She could only hope for the best.

A: b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions. Amy hoped and wished for certain outcomes, but did not think she could control the final admissions decisions.

Emma wanted to stay in her hometown after graduating because she valued her relationships with family and friends there. She applied for jobs both in her hometown and the city. She ended up finding a job in her hometown but not the city. The passage doesn't directly state whether Emma believed she could control her future by choosing to stay in her hometown. However, since she did end up finding a job there, she may have believed that staying close to home would lead to better career opportunities. But it's not definitive based on the information given.

A: a. Emma believed that her future was uncertain, and her choice of location may not necessarily lead to the desired outcome.

I chose option a because while Emma hoped staying in her hometown would allow her to find a job, the passage does not confirm she believed she could fully control her future that way. Her future likely felt uncertain, and staying in her hometown increased her odds but did not guarantee finding a job.
