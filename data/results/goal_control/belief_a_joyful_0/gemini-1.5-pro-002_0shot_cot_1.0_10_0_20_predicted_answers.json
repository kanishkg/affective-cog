        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEliza's primary goal was to enjoy the play.  She believed the theater had a good reputation, suggesting she thought it likely she *would* enjoy it.

However, she was less concerned with meeting the actors, indicating she may have seen that as less within her control. The passage states she enjoyed the play but *didn't* meet the actors, which further supports the idea she saw meeting them as less certain.\n\nA:b. Eliza believed that her enjoyment of the play and the chance to meet the actors are outside of her control.\n"
