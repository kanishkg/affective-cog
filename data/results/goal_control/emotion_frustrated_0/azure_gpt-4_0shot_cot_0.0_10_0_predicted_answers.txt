- Ben wants to increase his client base, specifically with local clients.
- He values supporting small businesses and building personal relationships.
- He does not want to work with high-profile clients due to fear of pressure.
- Despite his efforts, he attracts high-profile clients and not the local clients he desires.
- This situation is contrary to his goals and preferences.

Given this information, Ben is likely not joyful because he did not achieve his goal of attracting local clients. He is probably not grateful either, as the clients he attracted are not the ones he wanted to work with. The most appropriate feelings based on the situation would be frustration or disappointment because he did not get the results he was aiming for. Between the two, disappointment might imply a more passive response to the outcome, while frustration suggests an active discontent with the situation. Since Ben had specific goals and the outcome was contrary to his desires, frustration might be the more fitting emotion.

Gary is passionate about music and dreams of becoming a professional musician.
He wants to join the school band to develop his skills and gain performance opportunities.
He does not want to join the school choir because he lacks confidence in his singing abilities.

However, the supporting role has potential for growth, which might mitigate his disappointment slightly. The options joyful and grateful do not align with his initial desire for the leading role and his fear of being limited by a supporting role.
