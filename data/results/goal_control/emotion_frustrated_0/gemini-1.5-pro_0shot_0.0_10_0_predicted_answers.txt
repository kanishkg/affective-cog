## Analyzing Eliza's Emotional State

Given the context, let's break down Eliza's potential feelings:

* **Joyful (a):**  This is unlikely. While she enjoys meeting the actors, the play itself, her primary goal, was not enjoyable. 
* **Disappointed (b):** This is a strong possibility. The play did not meet her expectations, leading to disappointment despite the positive actor interaction. 
* **Frustrated (c):**  Frustration might arise if she felt the play *should* have been good based on the theater's reputation. However, disappointment seems more directly related to her unmet expectations.
* **Grateful (d):** Gratitude doesn't fit the situation. While she might be grateful for meeting the actors, the overall experience was not positive.

Therefore, the most likely answer is: **A: b. disappointed.** Eliza is likely disappointed because she did not enjoy the play, despite having positive interactions with the actors. 

A: a. disappointed. Rachel is likely to feel disappointed as her primary goal of gaining a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work was not met, despite attending the guided tour.
