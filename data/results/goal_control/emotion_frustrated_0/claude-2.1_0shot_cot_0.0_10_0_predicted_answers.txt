- Johnny is a high school baseball player who wants to play in college and get drafted to the MLB
- His goal is to get offers from university teams so he can play in college
- He invited university and minor league coaches to watch him play
- He got offers from minor league teams, but no university teams

A: c. disappointed

Getting offers only from minor league teams means he didn't achieve his goal.
