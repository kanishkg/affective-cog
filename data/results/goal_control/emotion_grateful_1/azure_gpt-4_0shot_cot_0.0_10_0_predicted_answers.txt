Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Amy wants to go to Harvard, which indicates that she would be happy if she got admitted there.
- Amy does not like Stanford and does not want to attend it, so being rejected from Stanford would not likely cause her disappointment.
- Since Amy gets into her preferred college, Harvard, and is rejected from the college she did not want to attend, Stanford, she would likely feel positive emotions.
- The options provided are grateful, disappointed, frustrated, and joyful. Disappointed and frustrated are negative emotions that do not fit the situation since she achieved her desired outcome. Between grateful and joyful, both could apply, but joyful is a stronger positive emotion that directly corresponds to the happiness she would feel from being admitted to her top choice.

A:d. joyful.

- Johnny is preparing for the conference finals, which is an important event for any high school athlete, especially one looking to be noticed by scouts.
- Johnny believes that his chances of receiving an offer are outside his control, indicating that he might feel a bit anxious or uncertain about the outcome.
- His goal is to receive offers from the Minor Leagues, not to play university baseball.
- He invites coaches from both university teams and Minor League teams, which shows he is open to being scouted by both but has a preference for the Minor Leagues.
- Johnny receives offers from Minor League teams, which aligns with his goal.
- Since he did not wish to play university baseball and did not receive offers from university teams, the lack of university offers should not affect his feelings negatively.
- Given that he received what he wanted, which is offers from Minor League teams, it is reasonable to assume that Johnny feels positive about the outcome.

- Emma is looking for a job and believes that her future is uncertain.
- She wants to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth.
- She fears stagnation if she stays in her hometown.
- Emma finds a promising job in the big city and cannot find one in her hometown.

From these points, it seems that Emma is likely to be happy or relieved because she has found a promising job in the big city, which aligns with her desires for better career opportunities and personal growth.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ben wants to increase his client base, specifically aiming for high-profile clients.
- He believes working with high-profile clients will provide better career opportunities and financial stability.
- Ben does not want to work with local clients due to fear of stagnation.
- He creates an online portfolio and shares it on social media platforms.
- The result is that Ben attracts high-profile clients, which aligns with his goal.

Given that Ben's actions have led to attracting the type of clients he wanted (high-profile clients), it is reasonable to infer that he would feel positive emotions regarding the outcome. The options "frustrated" and "disappointed" suggest negative emotions, which do not align with the successful outcome. "Joyful" and "grateful" are both positive emotions, but "joyful" might be a stronger expression of happiness, while "grateful" could imply a sense of thankfulness for the opportunities that have come his way. Since the story does not provide explicit details about his emotional state, we have to infer based on the successful outcome of his efforts.

A:d. grateful.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Eliza is a theater enthusiast, which means she has a strong interest in theater.
- Her primary goal for attending the production is to meet and connect with the actors, not necessarily to enjoy the play itself.
- The story states that Eliza meets and has engaging conversations with the actors, which means she achieved her primary goal.
- However, it also states that she did not enjoy the play itself.
- Since her main objective was met (connecting with the actors), and her enjoyment of the play was secondary and considered outside of her control, her feelings are likely to align more with the outcome of her primary goal.
- Therefore, even though she did not enjoy the play, the successful interaction with the actors would likely result in a positive emotion related to her primary goal.

A:c. grateful.
