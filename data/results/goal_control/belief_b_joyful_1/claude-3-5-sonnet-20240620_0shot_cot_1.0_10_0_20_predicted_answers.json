The fact that Ivan feels joyful suggests that making friends was more important to him than improving his fitness.\n\n8. This aligns more closely with option a, which states that making friends was Ivan's primary goal.\n\nA:a.

He was less concerned about improving his physical fitness.",

The story states: \"Ivan believes that by attending the group fitness class regularly, he can control his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he makes.\"\n5. This suggests that both goals were important to Ivan.\n6. However, the question also states that \"Ivan feels joyful.\"\n7.
