However, the story does not provide enough information to determine which specific expectations were not met.\n\nSince Ivan's goal was to improve physical fitness and not necessarily to make friends, and because he feels disappointed without a clear indication of what aspect disappointed him, we cannot accurately choose between improved physical fitness or making friends based on the information given. However, since making friends was less of a concern for him, it is less likely that this is the source of his disappointment, although without more information, this remains speculative.

The question of whether his experience led to improved physical fitness or new friendships is a bit tricky because the feeling of disappointment could relate to either aspect. However, since his main goal is improving physical fitness and he believes the group fitness class will help with that, the disappointment might not be related to physical fitness.

On the other hand, since making friends was a lesser concern, and Ivan believes making friends is outside of his control, his disappointment might not stem from this. The disappointment might also be related to the social aspect, which he had less control over, according to his belief.\n\nGiven this, it's a bit of a guess, but I will lean towards the physical fitness aspect since that was the primary goal for him and the area where he had set expectations for himself.\n\nA: a.
