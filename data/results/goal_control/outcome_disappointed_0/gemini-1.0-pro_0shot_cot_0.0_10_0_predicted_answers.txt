The story states that Ben wants to work with local clients but fears working with high-profile clients. The question asks if he attracted local clients or high-profile clients. Since the story does not provide any information about whether he attracted local or high-profile clients, we cannot answer the question definitively. However, we can make an educated guess based on the information provided.

Ben wants to work with local clients and has not expressed any desire to work with high-profile clients. Additionally, he has created an online portfolio and shared it on social media platforms, which are more likely to reach local clients than high-profile clients. Therefore, it is more likely that Ben attracted local clients.

A: a. Local clients

The passage states "Ivan is less concerned about making friends at the gym" and "Ivan's primary goal is to improve his physical fitness, and he believes attending group fitness classes will help him achieve this". This means that Ivan's main focus is on improving his physical fitness and making friends is not his priority. However, since the question only asks for the result of his gym experience and not his priority, we can consider both options. Option a states that Ivan made friends with other members of the group fitness class, which is aligned with the part of the passage that says "Ivan wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends". Option b states that Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence, which is also aligned with the part of the passage that says "Ivan believes that his physical fitness improvement and making friends are outside of his control, even if he attends the group fitness class" and "He is less concerned about making friends at the gym". Therefore, it is possible that Ivan achieved both improved physical fitness and new friendships.

A:b. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

A: a. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
