- Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness by attending group fitness classes
- Ivan believed that improving his fitness and making friends were outside of his control
- Ivan was less concerned about making friends compared to improving his fitness
- The passage does not clearly state whether Ivan improved his fitness or made new friends

So while attending the group fitness class may have helped Ivan work towards his goal of improving fitness, the passage does not confirm if he achieved that goal or made any new friends.

A: a. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

I do not have enough information to definitively choose one of the answer options. The passage states Ivan's goals but does not confirm the outcome. I provided my best attempt at reasoning through the available information.

From the story, we know that Max wants to find a unique outfit that will make a statement, even if it's expensive. He doesn't want to settle for a common outfit. 

Since Max feels disappointed at the end, he likely did not find the type of outfit he was looking for. 

The two answer options are:
A) An affordable outfit from a department store
B) A stylish, expensive outfit from a boutique

Given Max's preferences stated in the story, if he ended up with an affordable department store outfit, he would probably feel disappointed that it's not unique or expensive enough.

Therefore, the best guess is:
A: a. An affordable outfit from a department store.
