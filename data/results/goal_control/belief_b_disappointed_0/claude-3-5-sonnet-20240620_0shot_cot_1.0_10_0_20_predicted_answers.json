We need to determine which of these was more important to Ivan.\n4. The story mentions that Ivan \"becomes friends with other members of the group fitness class but is unable to improve his physical fitness.\"\n5. Despite achieving one goal (making friends) and not the other (improving fitness), Ivan feels disappointed.\n6. This disappointment suggests that the unachieved goal was more important to him.\n7. If making friends was his primary goal, he likely wouldn't feel disappointed since he succeeded in that aspect.\n8. Therefore, his disappointment indicates that improving his physical fitness was probably his primary goal.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the most likely answer is:\n\nA:b. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.",
