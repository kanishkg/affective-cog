After sharing his portfolio, Ben attracted high-profile multinational corporation clients but did not find local clients. This suggests Ben was hoping to attract local clients, not just high-profile ones. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if Ben wanted to avoid high-profile clients due to fear of pressure or stagnation with local clients.

A: b. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients. 

While the passage does not explicitly state Ben's reasons, it suggests he was disappointed at not finding local clients, meaning those were the type of clients he was hoping for when he shared his portfolio to increase his client base.

Ivan's primary goals were to improve his physical fitness and make new friends at the gym. The passage states that Ivan "wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends." This indicates he had two main goals. 

While Ivan was able to make new friends at the gym by attending the group fitness class, he was "unable to improve his physical fitness." This suggests that improving his fitness was a priority goal that unfortunately he did not achieve.

Making new friends seems like more of a secondary benefit Ivan hoped to gain rather than his main purpose for attending the gym and fitness classes. The passage does not suggest befriending people was his primary aim.

A: a. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.
