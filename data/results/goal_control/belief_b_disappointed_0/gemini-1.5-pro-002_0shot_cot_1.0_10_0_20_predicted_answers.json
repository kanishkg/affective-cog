It says he \"attracts high-profile clients\" but \"does not find local clients.\"  The question states he is disappointed.  This implies he wanted local clients, not just high-profile ones.  Nowhere does it state Ben's reasoning for wanting certain clients, so options discussing reasons for preferring one type to another are likely incorrect.\n\nA:b. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients. He did not want to work with high-profile clients because he fears he won't be able to handle the pressure.  Ben attracting high profile clients but no local clients, coupled with his disappointment, suggests he wanted local clients.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Ben \"attracts high-profile clients\" but \"does not find local clients.\"  It also says Ben believes client acquisition is \"beyond his control\".  This suggests Ben didn't specifically prefer one type of client over the other, but was open to whoever he could get.  Neither option (a) nor (b) reflect this.  However, option (b) is closer to the truth in that if Ben had a choice, he *might* have preferred working with locals, as it can be implied he may appreciate local businesses more.  Though, due to believing client acquisition is out of his hands, there's no indication that he would actively *avoid* high-profile clients, just that he'd perhaps prefer local ones, if given the choice. Option (a) states exactly the opposite.\n\nA:b. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients.
