## Analyzing Ivan's Gym Experience

Based on the information provided, we can analyze Ivan's potential experience and frustration:

**A: a. Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.**

**Explanation:**

* **Primary Goal:** Ivan's main focus was making friends, not necessarily improving fitness.

## Analyzing Gary's Possible Frustration 

To determine the source of Gary's potential frustration, we need to analyze his preferences and the potential outcome of the auditions:

* **Preference:** Gary clearly prefers the **school choir** due to its focus on vocal skills and performance opportunities. He has reservations about the school band due to time constraints impacting his individual practice.
* **Possible Outcomes:**
    * **Accepted into Choir:** This would likely result in happiness and satisfaction, not frustration.
    * **Accepted into Band:**  This scenario aligns with potential frustration, as it contradicts Gary's preference and concerns. 
    * **Rejected from Both:** While disappointing, the text doesn't provide enough context to suggest this would lead to frustration specifically.

## Answer

Based on the analysis above, the most likely answer is:

**A: b. School band.** Gary likely got accepted into the school band, which contradicts his preference and concerns, leading to frustration. 

## Analyzing Max's Situation:

We know Max:

* **Prioritizes affordability:** He wants a cost-effective outfit, even if it's not the most unique.
* **Is frustrated:** This implies he likely didn't find what he desired or had difficulty with his search.

## Evaluating Options:

a. **An affordable outfit from a department store:**  This aligns with Max's priority and is a likely outcome considering his frustration. He might have settled for something less than ideal due to budget constraints.

b. **A stylish, expensive outfit from a boutique:**  This contradicts Max's focus on affordability.  His frustration suggests he wouldn't choose this option. 

## Conclusion:

Based on the information, the most probable answer is: 

**A: a. An affordable outfit from a department store.**
