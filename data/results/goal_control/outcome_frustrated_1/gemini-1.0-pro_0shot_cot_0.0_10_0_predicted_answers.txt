The question asks about Eliza's experience at the theater leading to her enjoying the play or meeting the actors. The passage states that Eliza "watched the play", but it does not mention anything about her enjoying it or meeting the actors. However, option 'a' states that Eliza "met and had engaging conversations with the actors but did not enjoy the play itself", which is not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, we can eliminate option 'a'.

Option 'b' states that Eliza "enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors", which is also not mentioned in the passage. However, this option is more plausible than option 'a' because it does not contradict the information in the passage. Therefore, we can choose option 'b'.

A:b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.
