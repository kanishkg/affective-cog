- Johnny is a high school student who plays baseball and wants to receive offers from Minor League teams, not university teams
- Johnny invited both university and Minor League coaches to watch him play in the conference finals
- The question asks if Johnny received offers from universities or minor league teams
- Since Johnny did not want offers from universities, he would feel frustrated if that's what he received

A: a. Minor league baseball teams

Johnny wanted offers from Minor League teams, so if he feels frustrated, it suggests he received unwanted offers from universities instead.

 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ivan's primary goal is to make new friends at the gym by attending group fitness classes
- He believes attending the classes will help him meet like-minded people 
- He is less concerned about improving his physical fitness
- The passage states Ivan attended a group fitness class at the gym
- It does not confirm whether or not Ivan made any new friends
- So there is no evidence he gained new friendships from attending the class
- There are also no details on whether his fitness improved

A: a. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

While this option states Ivan improved his fitness, the passage does not confirm this. Ivan's goal was to make new friends, and there is no evidence presented that he achieved that goal nor improved his fitness. So neither option can be confirmed based on the details provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional options to choose from!

Gary auditioned for both the school choir and the school band because he is passionate about music and wants more performance experience. He preferred the choir because he felt it would help improve his vocal skills. However, the passage does not state which group, if any, accepted Gary after the auditions. 

Since the results of the auditions are not provided, the best guess is that Gary did not get accepted into either group. This would explain why he feels frustrated.

A: b. The passage does not provide enough information to determine which group accepted Gary. He may have not been accepted into either group, which would explain his frustration.
