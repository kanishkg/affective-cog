        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Rachel is an art enthusiast attending a special exhibition featuring her favorite artist.\n- Rachel's primary goal is to connect with fellow art enthusiasts.\n- She is less concerned about learning more about her favorite artist's work.\n- Rachel actively engages in the guided tour and asks questions.\n- The question mentions that Rachel feels frustrated, but it does not specify the reason for her frustration.\n- Given that her goal was to connect with people rather than learn more about the art, and there is no information suggesting that she achieved or did not achieve her goal of making new friendships, we cannot assume that her frustration is due to not making friends.\n- Therefore, it is slightly more likely, based on the information provided, that her frustration stems from the expectation related to her less important goal\u2014gaining a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work, which might not have been met despite her engagement in the tour.\n\nA:a. Rachel gained a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work."
