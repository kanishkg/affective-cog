From the story, we know that Ben wants to work with high-profile clients because he believes it will provide better career opportunities and financial stability. However, the story does not confirm whether he actually attracted those types of clients. The story just says that Ben felt disappointed after sharing his online portfolio. This likely means he did not attract the type of clients he was hoping for.

So the best guess is that Ben attracted local clients rather than high-profile clients, leading to his disappointment.

Ivan's primary goal was to make new friends at the gym by attending group fitness classes. However, he believed that making new friends was outside of his control. After attending a group fitness class, Ivan felt disappointed. Since making new friends was his main goal, and he believed it was out of his control, the disappointment likely means he did not make any new friends in the class. While he may have improved his physical fitness, the passage states he was less concerned about that.

A: b. Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.

I chose option B because Ivan's primary goal was to make new friends, but he felt disappointed after the class. This suggests he did not make any new friends as he had hoped. His physical fitness was not his main priority.
