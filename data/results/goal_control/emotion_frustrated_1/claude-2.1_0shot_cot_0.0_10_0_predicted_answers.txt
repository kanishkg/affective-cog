- Johnny is a high school student who plays baseball and wants to get an offer from a Minor League team
- He invited both university and Minor League coaches to watch him play in the conference finals
- Johnny received multiple offers from universities, but no offers from Minor League teams
- Since his goal was to get a Minor League offer so he could train and play professionally, he likely feels disappointed that he did not achieve that goal

A: d. disappointed

Johnny likely feels disappointed because he did not receive any offers from Minor League teams, which was his ultimate goal. He received university offers instead, but he was not interested in playing university baseball. So the best option capturing his likely feelings is "disappointed".

- Ivan's primary goal is to make friends at the gym by attending group fitness classes
- Ivan attends a class but improves his fitness without making any friends
- Since making friends was Ivan's main goal, not improving fitness, he likely feels disappointed that he didn't achieve his primary aim

A: b. disappointed

I chose disappointed as Ivan's primary goal of making friends was not achieved, even though he did improve his fitness which was secondary. He likely feels let down that attending the class did not lead to the main outcome he wanted.

1) Gary is passionate about music and dreams of becoming a professional musician
2) He wants to join the school choir to improve his vocal skills and get performance opportunities
3) He does not want to join the band because he thinks it may not give him enough individual practice time
4) Gary auditions for both band and choir
5) He is accepted into the band but not the choir
</thought>

A: c. disappointed

Gary wanted to join the choir more than the band. Even though he was accepted into the band, he was likely disappointed that he did not make it into the choir which was his first choice.

Eliza's primary goal is to meet and connect with the actors after the play, as she wants to become an actor herself. She is less concerned with enjoying the play itself. After watching the play, she enjoyed it but did not get to meet any actors. Since meeting the actors was her main goal, and she was not able to do that, she likely feels disappointed that she didn't achieve her primary objective. 

A: b. disappointed

Eliza feels disappointed because she did not get to meet the actors after the play, which was her main goal in attending. Even though she enjoyed the play itself, that was less important to her than making connections with the actors to further her acting aspirations. So the best option representing her likely feelings is "disappointed".

Rachel's primary goal was to connect with fellow art enthusiasts at the museum. She believed attending the guided tour would help her meet like-minded people. However, while she gained a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work, she did not meet any fellow art enthusiasts.

She gained something from the experience by learning more about the artist's work, but that was not her main motivation for attending.
