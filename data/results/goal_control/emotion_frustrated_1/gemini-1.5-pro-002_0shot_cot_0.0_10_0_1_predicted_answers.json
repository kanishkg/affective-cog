He invited coaches from both university and Minor League teams to watch him play, hoping to impress the latter.  He received offers from universities, but not from any Minor League teams.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEthan wants a supporting role, not the lead role. He gets the lead role, which is the opposite of what he wants.  Therefore, he is likely to be unhappy. The options that reflect unhappiness are 'frustrated' and 'disappointed'. 'Grateful' and 'joyful' reflect happiness, so they are unlikely. Between 'frustrated' and 'disappointed', 'disappointed' better reflects the emotion of not getting what he wanted.\n\nA:c. disappointed\n"
