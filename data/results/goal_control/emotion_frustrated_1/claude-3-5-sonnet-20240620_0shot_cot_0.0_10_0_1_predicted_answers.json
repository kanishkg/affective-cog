        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy's primary goal was to attend Harvard.\n2. She put effort into crafting a quality application, believing she could control the outcome.\n3. Amy explicitly disliked Stanford and didn't want to attend.\n4. She only applied to Stanford to appease her parents, not out of personal interest.\n5. Amy was rejected from Harvard, her dream school.\n6. She was accepted to Stanford, a school she dislikes.\n7. Getting into a prestigious school like Stanford would typically be cause for celebration, but not in Amy's case due to her dislike for the school.\n8. The rejection from Harvard likely overshadows the Stanford acceptance in Amy's mind.\n\nGiven these factors, Amy is most likely to feel a mix of disappointment (due to Harvard rejection) and frustration (because she got into a school she doesn't want to attend). Between the two options that best fit this situation, \"disappointed\" and \"frustrated,\" the stronger and more primary emotion is likely to be disappointment.\n\nA:a. disappointed"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Johnny's goal is to receive offers from Minor League teams, not universities.\n2. He specifically invited coaches from Minor League teams to watch him play.\n3. Johnny received multiple offers from universities, which wasn't his primary goal.\n4. He did not receive any offers from Minor League teams, which was his main objective.\n5. Getting university offers shows he played well, but it wasn't what he was aiming for.\n6. Not achieving his desired outcome (Minor League offers) is likely to cause negative emotions.\n7. Between the given options, \"frustrated\" or \"disappointed\" would be the most fitting emotions.\n8. \"Disappointed\" seems more appropriate as it directly relates to unmet expectations.\n\nA:b. disappointed"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Emma wants to move to the big city for better opportunities and personal growth.\n2. She doesn't want to stay in her hometown due to fear of stagnation.\n3. Emma believes she can control where she finds a job.\n4. She applies to various jobs, likely including ones in the city.\n5. However, she only finds a job in her hometown and not in the city.\n6. This outcome contradicts her desires and beliefs about control over her job search.\n7. The situation prevents her from achieving her goal of moving to the city.\n8. Given her strong desire to leave her hometown, finding a job there instead of the city would likely not make her feel grateful or joyful.\n9. The most likely emotions would be negative ones, such as frustration or disappointment.\n10. Between frustration and disappointment, disappointment seems more fitting as it reflects the gap between her expectations and reality.\n\nA:b. disappointed"

The gap between Ben's expectations and reality: He expected high-profile clients but got local ones instead.\n\nGiven this information, Ben is likely to feel negatively about the outcome.

This mismatch between his expectations and reality would most likely lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment.\n\nBetween the options provided, \"frustrated\" or \"disappointed\" would be the most appropriate. \"Grateful\" and \"joyful\" don't fit the situation as described.\n\nA:a. frustrated"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary's primary goal was to join the school choir, not the band.\n2. He believed joining the choir would help improve his vocal skills and provide performance opportunities.\n3. Gary specifically did not want to join the school band, as he thought it might interfere with his individual practice time.\n4. Despite his preferences and efforts, Gary was accepted into the band but rejected from the choir.\n5. This outcome is the opposite of what Gary wanted and expected.\n6. Given that Gary didn't get what he wanted and instead got what he didn't want, he's likely to feel negative emotions.\n7. Among the options provided, \"disappointed\" and \"frustrated\" are the negative emotions.\n8. \"Disappointed\" seems more appropriate as it directly relates to unfulfilled hopes or expectations, which matches Gary's situation.\n\nA:b. disappointed"

He finds a stylish outfit at a boutique.\n4. However, this outfit is described as \"quite expensive.\"\n5. Given that Max prioritizes affordability over uniqueness, finding an expensive outfit would not align with his goals.\n6. This situation is likely to cause negative emotions rather than positive ones.\n7. Among the given options, \"disappointed\" and \"frustrated\" are the negative emotions.\n8. \"Disappointed\" seems more fitting as it reflects the letdown of finding something stylish but not being able to afford it.\n9. \"Frustrated\" might be too strong of an emotion for this situation.\n\nA:a. disappointed"

Reason for wanting a supporting role: To learn from experienced actors and improve his craft.\n3. Reason for not wanting the leading role: Fear of overwhelming pressure.\n4. Outcome: Ethan got the leading role but no supporting roles were offered.\n5. Comparison of goal vs. outcome: Ethan did not get what he wanted (supporting role) and instead got what he was trying to avoid (leading role).\n6. Emotional response:\n   - Not likely joyful, as he didn't get what he wanted.\n   - Not likely grateful, as the outcome doesn't align with his desires.\n   - Could be frustrated, but this seems too strong given the information.\n   - Most likely disappointed, as the outcome is contrary to his hopes and desires.\n\nGiven these steps, the emotion that best fits Ethan's situation is disappointment.\n\nA:c. disappointed"
