        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from University teams.\n2. He invited coaches from both university and Minor League teams to watch him play.\n3. Johnny prepared for the conference finals, which suggests he was putting effort into his performance.\n4. The question states that Johnny feels disappointed after receiving only Minor League offers.\n5. Disappointment usually occurs when expectations are not met.\n6. For Johnny to feel disappointed, he must have believed he had a chance at getting university offers.\n7. The fact that he invited coaches and prepared for the finals indicates he thought his performance could influence the outcome.\n8. Option a suggests Johnny doesn't believe his play affects his chances, which contradicts his actions and disappointment.\n9. Option b aligns with Johnny's actions of preparing and inviting coaches, as well as his disappointment at the outcome.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Johnny likely believed he could control his chances of getting an offer through his preparation and performance.\n\nA:b.

If Emma believed she could control her future by choosing the right location (staying in her hometown), she would not have expected to be unable to find a job there.\n8.

Although making friends wasn't his primary goal, the fact that he attended a group class indicates he was open to social interaction, suggesting he believed he had some control over making friends as well.\n10.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary had a clear preference for joining the school band over the choir.\n2. He auditioned for both groups, indicating he understood there was a selection process.\n3. Gary's preference was based on his perceived strengths (instrumental skills) and weaknesses (singing abilities).\n4. The fact that Gary auditioned for both groups suggests he knew there was a possibility of being accepted into either, both, or neither.\n5. The outcome (being accepted into the choir but not the band) was contrary to Gary's preferences and expectations.\n6. Gary's disappointment indicates that the result was not what he had hoped for or expected.\n7. If Gary believed he could control the outcome, he likely wouldn't have auditioned for the choir or would have been more confident about getting into the band.\n8. The audition process itself implies an external evaluation, which is not under the direct control of the person auditioning.\n\nGiven these points, it appears that Gary understood that the outcome was not entirely in his control, even if he had hopes or expectations.\n\nA:b. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into."
