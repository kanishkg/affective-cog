Ben wanted to work with local small business clients rather than high-profile clients. He created an online portfolio and shared it, hoping to attract local clients. However, he ended up attracting high-profile clients instead. This suggests there was a disconnect between the types of clients Ben wanted to work with and the types of clients that were interested in his services based on how he marketed himself.

Even though Ben was disappointed that he attracted high-profile clients rather than local clients, the passage does not provide direct insight into whether or not Ben believed he could fully control the types of clients he acquires. Both promotional strategies and external factors likely play a role. 

Without any additional details that would help determine Ben's exact mindset, I will take my best guess between the two answer options:

A: b. Ben believed that the types of clients he acquires depends on factors beyond his control, such as market demand and competition.

I am choosing this option as it acknowledges external factors that likely also influence the types of clients acquired, rather than just Ben's own promotional efforts. However, this is still just my best guess given the limited information provided.
