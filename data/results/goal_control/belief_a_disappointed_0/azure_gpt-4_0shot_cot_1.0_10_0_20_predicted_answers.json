        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applied to both Stanford and Harvard, which indicates that she was engaging in the process of attempting to gain admission to these schools. Her feelings of disappointment after being rejected from Stanford suggest she had some level of expectation or hope regarding the outcome. While the feeling of disappointment alone does not necessarily mean she believed she could control the admissions process entirely, it does imply that she had hopes that her actions (completing and submitting applications) might lead to a favorable result. However, since most students are aware of the competitive and often unpredictable nature of college admissions, especially for prestigious institutions like Stanford and Harvard, it is likely that Amy knew she could not control the outcome completely.\n\nA:a.

The fact that she feels disappointed might suggest that she had expectations or desires regarding the outcome, but disappointment alone doesn't imply a belief that she could control whether or not she would be accepted. Since the admissions process for prestigious universities like Stanford and Harvard involves many factors beyond an individual's control, it's more likely that Amy is aware that the outcome isn't something she can dictate, even though she may have wished for a particular result.\nA:b.

The fact that she applied to both shows she was taking steps she believed could influence the admission process. However, the disappointment comes from an outcome that was not what she desired or expected. Disappointment often arises from unmet expectations, which can be based on the belief that one had some level of control or influence over the situation.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy's feeling of disappointment implies that she had hoped for a different outcome, specifically, being admitted to Stanford. If Amy believed she could not control the outcome at all, she might have been more resigned to any decision rather than disappointed. Disappointment often stems from an unmet expectation or hope, which in turn suggests that Amy believed there was at least some possibility of influencing the result in her favor, even if that belief wasn't strong or entirely rational (since college admissions involve many factors outside an applicant's control). However, the fact that she had hopes or expectations does not necessarily mean she believed she could control the outcome. Many people hope for outcomes they know they can't control. The key point is whether she believed her actions (completing and submitting her applications) could influence the admissions decision, which is often the case as students try their best to present a strong application. Yet, her actions alone do not guarantee control over the admissions decision as it is ultimately up to the admissions committee.\n\nA: a.

The disappointment suggests that her expectations regarding the enjoyment of the play were not met, but since she did meet the actors and had conversations with them, this part wasn't a source of disappointment. Based on this, it seems she felt she had some control over her enjoyment due to her expectation set by the theater's reputation, and she might have seen meeting the actors as a possible but not guaranteed outcome.\n\nA:a.

Eliza ended up meeting and talking with the actors, but she did not enjoy the play.\n4. The question asks if Eliza believed she could control her enjoyment and meeting the actors. Since she prioritized enjoyment and attending with the belief the theater had a good reputation, she likely thought she had some control over her enjoyment.\n5.

Her primary goal was to enjoy the play, so the disappointment likely stems from the play not meeting her expectations, an outcome she believed she had some control over by attending the play. However, her lessened concern about meeting the actors suggests that she may have seen that aspect as more chance-driven.\n\nA:b.

This result implies that her enjoyment wasn't guaranteed by just attending the play, which could suggest that she might have believed that her enjoyment was somewhat out of her control.\n- Eliza is less concerned about meeting the actors, but she does end up having engaging conversations with them. The fact that she considered meeting the actors as a secondary goal and was less concerned about it may suggest that she viewed this aspect as less within her control or as a bonus if it were to happen.\n- There is no indication that Eliza believed she could control either outcome by just her actions, as the quality of the play is generally out of the control of the audience, and meeting actors can depend on many factors, like the actors' availability or willingness to engage with the audience after the performance.\n\nA:a.

This indicates that her enjoyment was based on the quality of the production, which is generally outside of her direct control.\nEliza also had the secondary goal of potentially meeting some of the actors. Since she did meet them and had engaging conversations, it implies she believed that staying after the show could increase her chances of meeting them, which is something she could control to some extent.\nOverall, Eliza likely believed she had some control over meeting the actors by staying afterwards, but she may not have thought she could control her enjoyment of the play as much, as it depended on the play's performance, which is out of her control.\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEliza's primary goal is to enjoy the theater production. This suggests that she was going to the play with the expectation or belief that she would enjoy it, indicating a belief in some level of control over her enjoyment, at least in choosing to attend a theater with a good reputation. However, she ends up not enjoying the play, which points to the outcome of enjoyment not being entirely within her control, as it is based on her subjective experience and the play's performance, both of which are not directly controllable by her.\n\nEliza also ended up meeting actors, even though she was less concerned about this. Since she stayed after the play to meet them, this implies she believed she had some control over this by taking the action to stay and engage with the actors. However, the story does not clearly state that she believed she could control this; it simply happened as a result of staying afterwards.\n\nSince there is a distinction between what she wanted and what actually happened in both aspects (enjoyment of the play and meeting the actors), and because the story does not specifically state that she believed she could control these outcomes, it is more accurate to say that Eliza might have hoped or wished for a certain outcome but did not necessarily believe she had full control over either aspect.\n\nA: a.
