        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states Emma finds a promising job in the big city and cannot find one in her hometown.  Since she is grateful, it is implied she prefers the big city opportunity. The passage also mentions she believes her future is uncertain and the location of her job is outside of her control. This implies she is open to possibilities but doesn't have a strong preference initially. However, finding a job in the big city leads to gratitude, suggesting this aligns with a desire for better opportunities, even if not explicitly stated at the beginning.\n\nA:a. Emma wanted to move to the big city because she believes it will provide her with better career opportunities and personal growth.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states, \"Ben, a freelance graphic designer, is working from home and wants to increase his client base.\"  It then says, \"Ben attracts high-profile clients...but does not find local clients.\" This implies Ben was hoping for a wider range of clients, including local ones. There's no mention of his specific preferences for client types before he started his outreach.  Since the question asks what Ben *wanted* and the passage doesn't explicitly state it, we have to infer from the context. The options provided give two contrasting desires. Option 'b' aligns with the outcome, but the question is about his initial wants.\n\nA:a. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients. He did not want to work with high-profile clients because he fears he won't be able to handle the pressure.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states, \"Ivan, a young man who recently started going to the gym, wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends.\"  While he achieved one of his goals (making friends), the passage explicitly states both were goals.  It doesn't say one was prioritized over the other.\n\nA:a. Ivan's primary goal was to make friends at the gym, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him meet like-minded people. He was less concerned about improving his physical fitness.\n"

Option 'a' aligns with this reasoning.\n\nA:a. Gary wanted to join the school choir because he believes it will help him improve his vocal skills and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He did not want to join the school band because he thinks it may not give him enough time to focus on his individual music practice.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEliza felt grateful after the play. This suggests that something she hoped for happened. She met and had engaging conversations with the actors.  The question asks about her primary goal. Since she achieved the actor interaction and felt grateful, that was likely her main aim. She didn't enjoy the play itself, so that wasn't her primary goal.\n\nA:a. Eliza's primary goal was to meet and connect with the actors in the play, as she aspires to be an actor herself. She was less concerned about whether she enjoys the play itself.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Rachel befriended fellow art enthusiasts during the tour, but did *not* gain a deeper understanding of the artist's work.  It also says that she believed her experience depended on factors like the quality of the tour and the people she met.  Since she achieved one of these (meeting people) and seemed to prioritize these factors, it's more likely her primary goal was social.\n\nA:a. Rachel's primary goal was to connect with fellow art enthusiasts, and she believed attending the guided tour would help her meet like-minded people. She was less concerned about learning more about her favorite artist's work.\n"
