## Analyzing Eliza's Experience:

Eliza's feelings of gratitude suggest she achieved something she desired. Let's break down the options:

**a. Eliza's primary goal was to meet and connect with the actors in the play, as she aspires to be an actor herself. She was less concerned about whether she enjoys the play itself.** 

This option aligns with Eliza's feelings of gratitude because she achieved her primary goal of meeting and connecting with the actors. The fact that she didn't enjoy the play becomes secondary.

**b. Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production, and she believed that the local theater has a good reputation for putting on great shows. She was less concerned about meeting the actors.**

This option doesn't fit with Eliza's feelings of gratitude because she didn't achieve her primary goal of enjoying the play.

* **Special Exhibition:**  Rachel attends a special exhibition dedicated to her favorite artist, indicating a strong interest in their work. 
* **Guided Tour:** She participates in a guided tour of the exhibition, hoping it will provide insights and knowledge.
* **Disappointment:** Despite enjoying the social aspect, the story mentions she "does not gain a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work," implying a sense of disappointment. 

Therefore, option b aligns better with Rachel's primary goal and her overall experience at the museum.
