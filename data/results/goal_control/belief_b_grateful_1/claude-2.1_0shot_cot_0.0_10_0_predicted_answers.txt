Thought: Let's think step by step:
Emma recently graduated from college and was looking for a job. She applied to various jobs, but could only find a promising one in the big city, not in her small hometown. The passage states that Emma believes her future is uncertain and the location of her job is outside of her control. When Emma finds the job in the big city, the passage says she feels grateful. This suggests that Emma wanted to move to the big city for better career opportunities, rather than stay in her small hometown.

A: b. Emma wanted to move to the big city because she believes it will provide her with better career opportunities and personal growth. She did not want to stay in her hometown because she fears stagnation.
 <admin> Let's think through this step-by-step:

Thought: Ben created an online portfolio and shared it on social media in order to increase his client base. The passage states that Ben attracted high-profile clients who require graphic design work for multinational corporations, but did not find local clients. 

When asked what kind of clients Ben wanted to work with, option B states that Ben wanted to work with high-profile clients because he believes it will provide better career opportunities and financial stability. Option A suggests Ben wanted to work with local clients to support small businesses and build personal relationships.

Since the passage shows that Ben ended up attracting high-profile clients after sharing his portfolio, this suggests he was likely aiming to get those types of clients rather than local ones. Therefore, option B more accurately reflects what kind of clients Ben wanted.

A: b. Ben wanted to work with high-profile clients because he believes it will provide him with better career opportunities and financial stability. He does not want to work with local clients because he fears stagnation.

Ivan's primary goals were to improve his physical fitness and make new friends at the gym. However, he believed these goals were outside of his control, even if he attended group fitness classes.

Let's think step-by-step:
1) Gary is passionate about music and dreams of becoming a professional musician
2) He is considering joining either the school band or choir to gain more experience and exposure
3) Gary believes the outcome of the auditions is uncertain and he may not get into the group he wants
4) Gary auditions for both band and choir
5) Gary gets into the choir but not the band
6) The question asks what musical future Gary wanted based on these events
</thought>

A: b. Gary wanted to join the school choir because he believes it will help him improve his vocal skills and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He did not want to join the school band because he thinks it may not give him enough time to focus on his individual music practic.

Gary auditioned for both groups because he was uncertain of the outcome. By feeling grateful after getting into the choir, it shows that was his preference. The band may not have allowed him to focus on his individual music skills as much.

First, the passage states that Ethan is an aspiring actor who is passionate about acting. This suggests he likely wanted a sizable role to showcase his talent. 

Second, the passage says Ethan believes getting a role depends on the casting directors' preferences and other outside factors. This tells us Ethan wanted the leading role but recognizes it may be out of his control.

A: b. Ethan wanted the leading role because he believed it would showcase his talent and lead to more acting opportunities. He did not want a supporting role because he feared it may limit his potential.
