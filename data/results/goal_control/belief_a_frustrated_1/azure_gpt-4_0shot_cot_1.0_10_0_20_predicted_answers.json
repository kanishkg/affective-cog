This frustration could stem from a belief that she could have done something to influence the admissions process in her favor, especially for Harvard, which was her first choice. However, frustration alone does not necessarily imply that she thought she could control the outcome, as it's common for applicants to hope for the best while understanding that many factors beyond their control influence college admissions decisions.

Generally, the college admissions process is understood to be competitive and influenced by many factors beyond an applicant's control.\n- Feeling frustrated about the outcome suggests that the result was not what Amy desired or expected, but it doesn't necessarily mean she believed she could control it.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy has hopes to be admitted to Harvard, which indicates that she desires a particular outcome.\n2. The fact that she feels frustrated when she doesn't get into Harvard suggests she had some expectation or hope of being admitted.\n3. However, hope and frustration do not necessarily equate to a belief in control. One can hope for an outcome and still recognize that the result is not entirely within their control.\n4. The information given does not provide any clear indication that Amy believed she could control the admissions process, only that she had preferences and hopes.\n5. College admissions, especially at prestigious universities like Harvard, are widely recognized as being competitive and not entirely predictable, which may imply a general understanding that applicants can't fully control the outcome.\n\nA:a.

Amy applied to both Harvard and Stanford, indicating that she understood the necessity of engaging with the admissions process, which is an action taken to try to influence the outcome.\n2. Amy's hope to be admitted to Harvard suggests that she believed her application might be successful, implying some degree of belief in her ability to influence the outcome.\n3. However, the mere act of applying doesn't guarantee belief in control over admissions decisions since the process is known to be competitive and often unpredictable.\n4. The fact that Amy feels frustrated after her rejection from Harvard could mean that she had some expectations of success and thus believed her actions could have an impact on the outcome.\n\nHowever, since the college admissions process is known to be highly competitive and often relies on factors beyond an applicant's control, most applicants are aware that they cannot fully control the outcome. Amy's frustration could stem from the hope or expectation that she would be admitted, but that doesn't necessarily mean she believed she could control the entire process.\n\nGiven these considerations, it's more likely that Amy knew she couldn't control the outcome completely, but like most applicants, she might have had hopes that her efforts would be enough to influence a positive outcome.\n\nA:b.

If she completely believed the outcome was out of her control, she might not feel frustrated by the rejection; rather, she might be indifferent. However, the fact that she feels frustrated could indicate that she had some expectation of control or influence over the admissions process, and the rejection from Harvard contradicted that belief. It's worth noting that believing one can influence an outcome doesn't mean they believe they have full control; external factors always play a role in college admissions.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy hopes to be admitted to Harvard, which implies a level of optimism or desire about the outcome.\n- However, being frustrated by the outcome (rejected from Harvard and accepted to Stanford) could stem from either a belief that she could control the admissions process and failed, or from a recognition that despite her efforts the process was out of her control, and she was disappointed with the result.\n- There's not enough information to definitively say whether Amy believed she could control the outcome or not. Applying to colleges, in general, indicates a hope that she can present herself in the best light to influence a decision, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she believes the outcome is fully within her control, as college admissions are known to be competitive and unpredictable.\n- The frustration could be a result of her not getting what she hoped for, irrespective of whether she believed she could control it or not.\n\nA:a.

Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy's feeling of frustration upon being rejected from Harvard and accepted into Stanford suggests that there was a discrepancy between her expectations and the actual outcome. This frustration can arise from believing that one has some level of control over an event and that the event did not turn out as hoped or planned. If Amy believed she could not control the outcome at all, she might be disappointed, but less likely frustrated, since the rejection would be seen as entirely out of her hands. The act of applying to colleges, in itself, also indicates a belief that one can present oneself in a way that may influence the decision, thus exercising some level of perceived control over the outcome.\n\nA:b.

The fact that she \"hopes\" suggests that she desired a positive outcome, but it does not necessarily imply she believed she could control the admissions process. College admissions are known to be competitive and often unpredictable, which most applicants are aware of. There's no indication in the story that Amy took any extraordinary steps that would suggest she believed she could control the process, such as trying to influence the admissions committee directly.

Amy also applied to Stanford at her parents' request, despite not wanting to attend, which suggests she was making an effort to have backup options or please her parents rather than acting on the belief that she could secure her admission to Harvard.\n3. The fact that Amy feels frustrated upon rejection from Harvard indicates that she had some level of expectation or hope of being admitted, which can be tied to a belief that her application efforts might influence the outcome.\n4. However, since Amy did apply to another school despite disliking it, there is an implication that she acknowledged the uncertainty of admissions and wanted to ensure she had alternatives, which points to an understanding that she couldn't fully control the admissions outcome.\n\nA:b.
