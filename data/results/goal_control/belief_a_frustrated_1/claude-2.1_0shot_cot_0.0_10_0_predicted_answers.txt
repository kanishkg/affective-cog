From the story, we know that Amy really wanted to go to Harvard and hoped she would be admitted. This means she likely believed that whether or not she was admitted was at least partially under her control through the quality of her application. However, since she was ultimately rejected from Harvard, the outcome was not fully under her control.

She also applied to Stanford mainly to appease her parents, suggesting she did not actually want to go there. So whether or not she got into Stanford was probably less important to her and not something she felt she could fully control.

Overall, while Amy likely believed her actions could influence the outcome to some degree through the quality of her applications, she probably recognized that admissions decisions are complex and the final outcomes were not entirely under her control.

A: a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.</answer>

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Emma wanted to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth
- She didn't want to stay in her small hometown because she feared stagnation
- This means Emma believed that choosing the right location (the big city) would lead to the future and career opportunities she desired
- Even though she ended up finding a job in her hometown and not the city, the passage states that Emma "believed" the city would provide her with better opportunities

A: a. Emma believed she could control her future by choosing the right location.

I chose option A because the passage directly states that Emma believed moving to the big city "will provide her with better career opportunities and personal growth." This indicates she thought she could control and direct her future by choosing the location that aligned with her career goals.

Ben wanted to work with high-profile clients because he thought it would provide better career opportunities and financial stability. He did not want to work with local clients because he feared stagnation. This shows Ben believed he could control the types of clients he acquires by being selective about who he works with. 

When he shared his online portfolio, he attracted local small business clients rather than the high-profile clients he wanted. This frustrated Ben because the actual clients he acquired were not what he expected or wanted.

So Ben initially believed he could control the types of clients he acquires through his promotional efforts and by being selective. But the outcome shows there are other factors beyond his control that determine what types of clients he actually acquires.

A: b. Ben believed he could control the types of clients he acquires by promoting his work and networking effectively

Eliza's primary goal was to meet and connect with the actors, as she wants to become an actor herself. She was less concerned about enjoying the play. After watching the play, she enjoyed it but did not get to meet any actors. Her frustration stems from not achieving her main goal of meeting the actors, not from not enjoying the play. This suggests Eliza believed she could control the likelihood of meeting the actors by attending the play and staying afterwards, but did not necessarily believe she could control her enjoyment of the play itself.

A: b. Eliza believed that by attending the play and staying afterwards, she could control her enjoyment of the play and the likelihood of meeting the actor
