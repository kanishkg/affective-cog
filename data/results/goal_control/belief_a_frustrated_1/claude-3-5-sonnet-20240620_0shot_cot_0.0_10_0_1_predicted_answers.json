        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy wanted to go to Harvard and hoped to be admitted.\n2. She applied to Stanford only to appease her parents, not because she wanted to attend.\n3. Amy completed and submitted her applications, which is the extent of what she could control.\n4. The question states that Amy feels frustrated after the results.\n5. Frustration often occurs when outcomes don't match expectations, especially when we believe we had some control over the situation.\n6. The fact that Amy feels frustrated suggests that she believed she had some influence over the outcome.\n7. If Amy didn't think she could control the outcome at all, she would be more likely to feel disappointed but not necessarily frustrated.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it appears that Amy believed she had some control over the admissions process, even though the final decision was ultimately out of her hands.\n\nA:a. Amy thought she could control the outcome of her college admissions"

He prepared for the conference finals, which suggests he put effort into his performance.\n3. Johnny specifically invited coaches from Minor League teams to watch him play.\n4. He received multiple university offers but no Minor League offers.\n5. The question states that Johnny feels frustrated.\n6. Frustration often comes from a mismatch between expectations and outcomes.\n7. If Johnny believed he had no control over the outcome, he likely wouldn't feel frustrated.\n8.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Emma wanted to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth.\n2. She believed staying in her hometown would lead to stagnation.\n3. Emma actively applied for jobs in the city, showing her belief that moving there would improve her prospects.\n4. She had a clear preference for the city over her hometown for her career goals.\n5.

He was less concerned about improving his physical fitness.\n4. Ivan attended a group fitness class.\n5. The outcome was that Ivan improved his physical fitness but did not find friends.\n6. Ivan feels frustrated with this outcome.\n7. The question asks if Ivan believed he could control both his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he made.\n8. Given that Ivan chose to attend the group fitness class as a means to make friends, it suggests he believed his actions could influence the outcome.\n9. Although he was less concerned about physical fitness, attending a fitness class implies he understood it could affect his fitness level.\n10. The fact that Ivan feels frustrated indicates that the outcome didn't meet his expectations, suggesting he believed he had some control over the results.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that Ivan believed his actions (attending the group fitness class) could influence both his physical fitness and his ability to make friends.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary had a clear preference for joining the choir over the band.\n2. He auditioned for both groups, indicating he was open to either possibility.\n3. Gary had specific reasons for wanting to join the choir (improve vocal skills, performance opportunities).\n4. He had reasons for not wanting to join the band (less time for individual practice).\n5. Despite his preferences, Gary still auditioned for both groups.\n6. The outcome was contrary to Gary's wishes - he was accepted into the band but not the choir.\n7. Gary feels frustrated with this outcome.\n8. If Gary believed he could control the outcome, he likely wouldn't feel frustrated, as he would have ensured his acceptance into the choir.\n9. The fact that Gary auditioned for both groups suggests he understood there was a possibility of not being accepted into his preferred choice.\n\nGiven these points, it appears that Gary understood the audition process involved factors beyond his control, and the outcome was not guaranteed.\n\nA:a. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into."

This shows that Max was taking deliberate actions to find what he wanted.\n5. The question mentions that Max feels frustrated, which suggests he had expectations about finding an outfit.\n6. His frustration likely comes from not finding what he wanted (affordable and stylish) despite his efforts.\n7. The fact that he put in effort and feels frustrated indicates that he believed his actions could lead to finding the right outfit.\n8. If Max believed it was purely a matter of luck, he probably wouldn't have put in so much effort or felt as frustrated.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Ethan wanted a supporting role, not the leading role.\n2. He had specific reasons for wanting a supporting role:\n   - To learn from more experienced actors\n   - To improve his craft\n   - To avoid the pressure of a leading role\n3. Ethan performed his audition piece in front of the casting directors.\n4. He ended up getting the leading role, which was not what he wanted.\n5. The question states that Ethan feels frustrated.\n6. If Ethan believed he could control the outcome of his audition, he would have expected to get the role he wanted (a supporting role).\n7. The fact that he got a role he didn't want and feels frustrated suggests that the outcome was not what he expected or aimed for.\n8. This implies that Ethan likely believed his performance would determine the role he was offered, but the result didn't match his expectations.\n\nGiven this reasoning, it appears that Ethan believed he had some control over the outcome through his performance, but the result didn't align with his intentions.\n\nA:b.
