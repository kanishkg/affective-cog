## Analyzing Max's Frustration

We can infer that Max feels frustrated because he couldn't find an outfit that met both his desire for style and affordability. Let's analyze the options:

**a. Max believed that finding the perfect outfit is a matter of luck and chance.**

This option doesn't quite fit. If Max believed finding the perfect outfit was purely luck, he wouldn't necessarily feel frustrated, just unlucky. 

**b. Max believed he could control the outcome by searching for the perfect outfit and trying on different options.**

This aligns better with Max's likely mindset. He actively searched for an outfit, indicating a belief that he could control the outcome by exploring options. His frustration suggests disappointment that his efforts didn't lead to the desired result. 

Therefore: 

**A: b. Max believed he could control the outcome by searching for the perfect outfit and trying on different options.**
