He invited coaches from both university and Minor League teams to watch him play, but his feelings of gratitude are most likely tied to achieving his desired outcome.

## Analyzing Ben's Client Acquisition Strategy 

Based on the information provided, Ben clearly prioritizes **local clients** due to his values and preferences. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether he was successful in attracting this desired clientele. Let's analyze the options:

* **a. High-profile clients**: This contradicts Ben's stated aversion to working with this type of client due to the pressure. 
* **b. Local clients**: This aligns with Ben's goals and values. His approach of creating an online portfolio and sharing it on social media could potentially reach local businesses. 

While we lack definitive confirmation of Ben's success, option b aligns better with his intentions and actions.

**Therefore, the most likely answer is: A:b. Local clients**

* **Method:** Attending group fitness classes 
* **Belief:** Outcomes (fitness and friendships) are outside his control

## Answering the Question:

**Q: Ivan feels grateful. Did Ivan's experience at the gym lead to improved physical fitness or new friendships?**

While we don't have explicit information about the exact outcome, we can analyze the options based on what we know:

* **a. Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.**  This option focuses on friendships, which was not Ivan's primary goal or concern. 
* **b. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.** This option aligns with Ivan's primary goal of improving his physical fitness. The addition of "gained confidence" also suggests a positive experience related to his fitness journey.

**Therefore, based on the available information, the most likely answer is:**

**A: b. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.**

## Analyzing Ethan's Situation:

Based on the information provided, we know Ethan desires the leading role and feels apprehensive about a supporting role. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state the outcome of his audition. We need to analyze his emotional state to make an educated guess. 

## Assessing Ethan's Emotions:

The question states Ethan feels "grateful." Gratitude typically arises from a positive outcome or receiving something desirable. 

## Making an Educated Guess:

Considering Ethan's preference and the emotion of gratitude, it's more likely he received the role he desired.

Therefore, the answer is: **A: a. Ethan got the leading role.**

Based on the information provided:

*   Eliza's primary goal was to **enjoy the play**.

Feeling grateful suggests a positive outcome related to her primary goal. 

Therefore:

**A: b. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.** 

A: a. Rachel gained a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work.
