1. Emma wants to stay in her hometown.
2. Emma applies to various jobs.
3. We do not know if Emma found a job in her hometown or in the big city.
4. However, the question asks us to choose one of the options ['a', 'b'].

Since we do not have enough information to determine whether Emma found a job in her hometown or in the big city, we can make an educated guess based on the information given.

Emma wants to stay in her hometown because she values her close relationships with family and friends. She does not want to move to the big city because she fears losing those connections. This suggests that Emma is more likely to have found a job in her hometown, where she can stay close to her loved ones.

Therefore, we can choose option b.

Q: Emma feels grateful. Did Emma choose to stay in her hometown or move to the big city?
Answer: b. Emma finds a job in her hometown.

1. Read the story and identify the relevant information: Ethan is passionate about acting and believes that the casting directors' preferences and other factors outside of his control will determine the role he is offered. He wants the leading role because he believes it will showcase his talent and lead to more acting opportunities. He does not want a supporting role because he fears it may limit his potential. Ethan performs his audition piece in front of the casting directors, but the story does not mention whether he got the leading role or a supporting role.
