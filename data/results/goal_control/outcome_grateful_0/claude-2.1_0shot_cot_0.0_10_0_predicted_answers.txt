Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness. He attended a group fitness class at the gym because he believed it would help him achieve this goal of improved fitness. The passage does not explicitly state whether Ivan made new friends or improved his fitness. However, since his main goal was fitness improvement, the most likely outcome is that the group fitness class helped Ivan improve his physical fitness. Making friends was less of a priority for Ivan.

A: a. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

I chose option A because it aligns with Ivan's primary goal of improving his physical fitness by attending the group fitness class. While he may have also made friends, the passage emphasizes that this was not his main focus.

From the story, we know that Ethan is an aspiring actor who wants the leading role in the play because he believes it will showcase his talent and lead to more opportunities. However, the question states that Ethan feels grateful after his audition. While the story does not directly state what role he received, the fact that Ethan feels grateful suggests he did not get the exact role he wanted, which was the leading role. If he had gotten the leading role, he likely would have felt excited, proud, or thrilled rather than just grateful. Therefore, the best guess is that Ethan received a supporting role and felt grateful for the opportunity.

A: b. Ethan got a supporting role.
