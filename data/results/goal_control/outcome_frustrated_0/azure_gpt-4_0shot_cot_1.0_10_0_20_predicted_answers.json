If his primary goal was to improve his fitness, and he's now frustrated, it might imply that he did not achieve the level of physical fitness improvement he was hoping for. There is no direct information about whether he made friends or not, but since making friends was a secondary goal, it is less likely that the frustration is related to that aspect, especially since the story doesn't provide any detail about social interactions or outcomes.
