- Ivan's primary goal is to improve his physical fitness by attending group fitness classes
- He is less concerned about making new friends at the gym
- The passage states that Ivan feels frustrated after attending a group fitness class
- His frustration likely stems from not achieving his primary goal of improving his fitness
- The options are about Ivan making new friends or improving his fitness

A: b. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.

I chose option b because even though Ivan felt frustrated after the class, his primary goal was to improve his fitness. The frustration may have been from the difficulty of the class. There is no indication he made new friends, which he was less concerned about anyway. So the best guess is that he worked on improving his fitness but has more progress to make, leading to some frustration.
