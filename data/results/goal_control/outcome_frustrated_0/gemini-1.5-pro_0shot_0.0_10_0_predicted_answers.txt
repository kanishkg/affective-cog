## Analyzing Ivan's Gym Experience:

We know Ivan prioritizes **physical fitness improvement** and sees the group class as a means to achieve that. We don't have enough information about his social interactions within the class. 

**Therefore, based on Ivan's primary goal and the limited information, the most likely outcome of his experience is:**

**A: b. Ivan improved his physical fitness and gained confidence.** 

## Analyzing Gary's Potential Frustration 

To determine which group might cause Gary frustration, we need to analyze his preferences and skillsets:

* **Prefers Band:** He desires to join the band due to his passion for music and belief in skill development through it.
* **Less Confident in Singing:** He lacks confidence in his singing abilities, making choir less appealing.

Therefore, if Gary **didn't get into the band**, his preferred option, he would likely feel frustrated. 

**A: a. School band. Gary would likely feel frustrated if he was accepted into the choir, which he did not prefer, and rejected by the band, his desired choice.** 

## Analyzing Max's Situation

Based on the description, Max prioritizes uniqueness and making a statement over affordability. He seems determined to find the perfect outfit and is willing to invest time and potentially money to achieve that.  His frustration likely stems from not finding an outfit that meets his expectations.

## Answer

**A: a. A stylish, expensive outfit from a boutique.** 

**Explanation:**  Given Max's preference for unique and statement-making clothing, and his willingness to spend more, a boutique offering stylish and potentially expensive outfits aligns best with his goals. His frustration implies he eventually found an outfit that met his criteria, and a boutique is more likely to offer such options compared to a department store. 

A: a. Ethan got a supporting role. 
***
Ethan's frustration likely stems from not getting the leading role he desired. 

## Analyzing Eliza's Theater Experience

Based on the information provided, we can deduce the following:

* **Eliza's primary goal:** Enjoying the play. 
* **Secondary goal:** Potentially meeting the actors (but less important).
* **Eliza's belief:** Attending the play and staying afterward influences achieving her goals.
* **Outcome:** Eliza feels frustrated.

Given Eliza's primary goal and her eventual frustration, we can infer that she did not achieve her main objective of enjoying the play.  Meeting the actors was a secondary goal, and her frustration is likely tied to the primary goal not being met.

Therefore, the most probable answer is: 

**A: a. Eliza enjoyed the play but did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.**
