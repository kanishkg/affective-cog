It is important to note that believing one can influence an outcome does not equate to having control over it. Amy's actions could have influenced her chances, but ultimately she did not have control over the decision made by the admissions committees.\n\nA: b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The fact that Amy feels disappointed after receiving the college admissions results implies that she had hoped for a different outcome, particularly with Harvard.\n- Hoping for a certain outcome often goes hand in hand with the belief that one has some level of control or influence over that outcome, especially when it involves a process like college admissions where the applicant is actively involved in crafting personal essays, curating their extracurriculars, and working hard on their grades.\n- Although the college admissions process is known to be highly competitive and somewhat unpredictable, students generally apply with the belief that their efforts can positively affect the result.\n- However, feeling disappointed alone doesn't necessarily indicate that she believed she could control the admissions process entirely; it could also mean that she had a strong preference and hoped that her efforts were enough.\n- Since Amy also applied to Stanford (even though she didn't want to go there) to appease her parents, this can suggest that she understands the admissions process is uncertain and that she can't control it entirely because she's taking a backup option seriously.\n\nGiven this information, while Amy may not have thought she could control the admissions process entirely (as evidenced by the backup application to Stanford), her disappointment in not getting into Harvard implies that she had some belief that her actions (application quality, grades, test scores, etc.) could potentially influence a positive outcome.\n\nA:b.

Disappointment can arise regardless of whether one believed they could control the outcome or not.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy hoped to be admitted to Harvard, which suggests that she desired a specific outcome. However, the story does not provide information about whether Amy believed her actions could guarantee that outcome. Applying to colleges often involves elements outside of an applicant's control, such as the admissions committee's preferences, the competition level, and various other factors. The fact that she applied to Stanford to appease her parents does not indicate her belief in controlling the outcome but rather shows a strategy to ensure she has options. The fact that Amy feels disappointed about not getting into Harvard could be because she hoped or wished for it, not necessarily because she thought she could control it. Since we don't have explicit information about Amy's beliefs regarding control over the admissions process, we cannot definitively say she thought she could control it.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy hopes to be admitted to Harvard, which indicates that she has a desire and possibly a belief in a positive outcome.\n- Applying to Stanford to appease her parents suggests she was trying to meet expectations or ensure a backup plan, not that she felt in control of the admissions process.\n- The fact that Amy is disappointed about the outcome implies that there was an expectation or hope that did not align with the reality. However, feeling disappointed does not necessarily mean she believed she could control the outcome.\n- Generally, college admissions are understood to be influenced by the applicant's efforts (grades, extracurricular activities, essays, etc.) but are ultimately decided by the admissions committees. This means that while applicants can strive to present their best selves, they do not have direct control over the decision-making process.\n\nBased on these thoughts, the fact that Amy hoped for admission but also applied to a school she did not want to attend as a backup plan indicates she was aware that the outcome was not entirely within her control.\n\nA:a.

However, hope and perceived control are not the same; one can hope for an outcome without believing they have control over it. Since the question is specifically about her belief in her ability to control the outcome, and not just her hopes or desires, her disappointment alone does not confirm she believed she had control over the admissions decision.\n\nA:b.

However, her feeling of disappointment after being rejected from Harvard and accepted to Stanford suggests that the outcome wasn't what she expected or desired. If she believed she could control the admissions outcome, she might have felt confident rather than simply hopeful, and her disappointment might imply she overestimated her influence on the process. Given that college admissions, especially for highly competitive schools like Harvard, involve many factors beyond an applicant's control (such as the decisions of the admissions committee, the pool of applicants, and institutional needs), it is more likely that Amy knew she could not control the outcome but still hoped for the best.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nIf Amy feels disappointed about the outcome, it suggests that she had an expectation or hope about getting into Harvard. Typically, people feel disappointed when something they expected, hoped for, or believed they could influence does not occur as they wanted. However, the mere act of feeling disappointed does not necessarily mean she believed she could control the outcome. It simply means she hoped for a specific result.\n\nThe college admissions process is widely known to be competitive and selective, especially for top-tier institutions like Harvard and Stanford. Most students are aware that they can influence their chances by submitting strong applications, but they also know that the final decision is not within their control due to the sheer number of variables involved, such as the pool of applicants, admissions criteria, and the decisions of the admissions committee.\n\nThe fact that Amy applied to Stanford as well to \"appease her parents\" implies she was trying to improve her chances of getting into a good school, even if it wasn't her first choice, which indicates a recognition that she does not have full control over the process. If she believed she could control admissions, she may not have bothered applying to a school she dislikes as a backup.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy's disappointment at being rejected from Harvard suggests that she had some expectation or hope of being admitted. The feeling of disappointment often arises when there's a gap between expectations and reality. If Amy believed she had no control over the outcome, she might have been more prepared for any result and potentially less disappointed. However, since the question asks if she believed she could control the outcome, it's crucial to note that most students understand that college admissions involve factors beyond their control, such as the decision-making process of the admissions committee.

Disappointment generally arises when there is a gap between one's expectations and reality. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Amy had some belief in a favorable outcome.\n- The ability to feel disappointment suggests that she believed there was a chance of her being admitted based on her application, which implies a degree of perceived control or influence over the admissions process.\n- However, there is no clear indication that Amy believed she had full control over the college admissions.
