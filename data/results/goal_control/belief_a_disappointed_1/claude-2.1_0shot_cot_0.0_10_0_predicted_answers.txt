 <admin> Got it, let me think step-by-step through this question and provide my best guess:

Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Emma wanted to move to the big city for better career opportunities and personal growth
- She didn't want to stay in her small hometown because she feared stagnation
- Emma applied for jobs in the city but could not find one there
- She did find a job in her hometown that she had to accept
- The passage doesn't explicitly state whether Emma believed she could fully control her future by moving locations
- But it seems she hoped and expected that moving would lead to better outcomes

A: a. Emma believed she could control her future by choosing the right location.

I choose option a because the passage suggests Emma believed moving locations would provide her with better opportunities and growth. Even though things did not work out as she had hoped in getting a city job, the text implies she did have an underlying belief that she could steer her future through her location choice.

5) However, audition results depend on the judgment of others, which he cannot completely control.

A: b. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into.

Max wanted to find an affordable stylish outfit for his school event. Even though he tried on different outfits at various stores, the stylish outfit he found at the boutique was too expensive for him.

So he likely did not believe he could fully control the outcome.

A: b. Max believed that finding the perfect outfit is a matter of luck and chance.
