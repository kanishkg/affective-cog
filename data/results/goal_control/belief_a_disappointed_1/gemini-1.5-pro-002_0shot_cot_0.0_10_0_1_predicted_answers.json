        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEmma clearly believed that moving to the big city would give her better opportunities and personal growth.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nIvan's primary goal in attending the group fitness class was to make friends. He believed that by attending the class, he would meet like-minded people and form friendships. This indicates that he believed he had some control over making friends.  He was less concerned with improving his physical fitness, implying he didn't necessarily believe he could control that aspect as much. However, the fact that he took the action of attending the class suggests he believed it could influence both outcomes to some extent.\n\nA:b. Ivan believed that by attending the group fitness class regularly, he could control his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he makes.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nGary auditioned for both band and choir. He expressed a preference for choir and a concern that band would take away from his individual practice time.  This suggests he had some expectation of being able to choose which group to join *if* accepted to both.  Therefore, he likely believed he had some control over the outcome, at least to the extent of being able to choose. The fact that he auditioned for both also suggests he wasn't entirely certain he'd get his first choice.\n\nA:b. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nMax is actively searching for an outfit and trying on different options. This shows he believes his actions (searching and trying on clothes) can lead to the desired outcome (finding a perfect outfit).  If he believed it was purely luck, he wouldn't put effort into searching. His disappointment stems from not finding an outfit that meets his criteria (affordable and stylish), not from a belief that the outcome was beyond his control.\n\nA:a. Max believed he could control the outcome by searching for the perfect outfit and trying on different options.\n"

This suggests she believed she had some control over whether she met them, perhaps by attending and staying after the play.  While she enjoyed the play, that wasn't her primary goal, so her enjoyment might have been less of a focus for control. Her disappointment stems from not achieving her goal of meeting the actors.\n\nA:a. Eliza believed that by attending the play and staying afterwards, she could control her enjoyment of the play and the likelihood of meeting the actors.\n"
