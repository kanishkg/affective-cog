        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- If Amy feels frustrated despite getting into Harvard, it suggests that her goal was not solely to get into any college, but specifically to get into a certain one.\n- Amy getting into Harvard would normally be a cause for celebration unless Harvard was not her top choice.\n- Since Amy is frustrated and she was rejected from Stanford, it is reasonable to assume that Stanford was the school she really wanted to attend.\n- The options given provide two scenarios: One, where Amy wanted to be closer to home and preferred Harvard, and another where she wanted to go to Stanford but applied to Harvard to appease her parents.\n- Based on the given information that she is frustrated, the more likely scenario is that she wanted to get into Stanford.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The question tells us Amy feels frustrated, suggesting that something did not go according to her wishes or expectations.\n- Amy got into Harvard but was rejected from Stanford.\n- Amy's frustration is likely linked to a disappointment. Since she was accepted to Harvard, it seems her disappointment would not stem from that acceptance.\n- Her frustration, then, is probably because she did not get into Stanford, which implies that Stanford was her preferred choice or she at least wanted the option to attend.\n- There is no information provided about her wishing to be closer to home or her feelings about Harvard beyond her application effort and eventual acceptance.\n- Since being accepted to Harvard would be considered a success in general, her frustration indicates that the rejection from Stanford was against her wishes.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy believes she can control the outcome of her college admissions, which implies she has confidence in her application's quality.\n- Amy gets into Harvard but is rejected from Stanford.\n- Amy feels frustrated despite getting into Harvard, which is generally considered a great achievement.\n- If Amy was happy with Harvard and did not wish to attend Stanford, her frustration would not be justified.\n- Therefore, it's more likely that Amy's frustration stems from not getting into the college she hoped to attend, which in this case is Stanford. Additionally, the mention of her dislike for Harvard and only applying there to appease her parents adds context to her frustration.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy believes that she can influence her college admissions by putting together a quality application, which means she cares about the outcome.\n- Amy gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford.\n- Amy feels frustrated despite getting into Harvard, which is a very prestigious school.\n- If she wanted to go to Harvard and not Stanford, the rejection from Stanford would likely not cause frustration since she got into her preferred school.\n- Since Amy is frustrated despite her Harvard acceptance, it suggests that the rejection from the school (Stanford) she did not get into is the source of her frustration.\n- Amy likely wanted to go to Stanford, and that is why she feels frustrated after being rejected.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy believes she can control the outcome of her college admissions by crafting a quality application. This indicates she cares about the process and outcome.\n- Amy completes and submits her college applications, suggesting she has put effort into applying to more than one institution.\n- Amy gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford.\n- Amy feels frustrated after these outcomes, which implies that the outcome was not fully in line with her desires or expectations.\n\nSince the question asks why Amy feels frustrated, we need to connect her frustration to the outcomes of her applications. The fact that she's frustrated after being accepted to Harvard and rejected from Stanford suggests that her preference was Stanford.\n\nA:a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy feels frustrated despite being accepted into Harvard.\nIf Amy wanted to go to Harvard and did not wish to attend Stanford, the news of her acceptance to Harvard should have made her happy, not frustrated.\nHowever, the fact that Amy feels frustrated after being rejected from Stanford suggests that she had hoped to be admitted there, implying that Stanford was her preferred choice or that she had some level of interest in attending Stanford.\n\nA:a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The information provided does not mention anything about Amy's preferences for proximity to home or her parents' wishes regarding Harvard.\n- Amy feels frustrated despite getting into Harvard, which is a prestigious institution. This implies that getting into Harvard was not her primary goal, or at least not sufficient for her satisfaction.\n- The frustration likely arises from being rejected by Stanford, which suggests that was the outcome she desired more.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- If Amy feels frustrated about her college admissions outcome, it implies that she did not get the result she desired.\n- Amy was admitted to Harvard but rejected from Stanford.\n- Feeling frustrated about this scenario suggests that Stanford was her preferred choice, as there would be no reason for frustration if she did not care about getting into Stanford.\n- It is stated that Amy gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford, which is the reason given for her frustration. This does not necessarily imply her preferences about the location of the schools or her parents' wishes.\n- The premise does not provide any information about Amy's preferences regarding proximity to home or about whether Harvard was a choice to appease her parents.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy is frustrated despite getting into Harvard, which implies that something else is causing this frustration.\n- Since college admissions are uncertain and Amy could not control the outcome completely, the rejection from Stanford may be the source of her frustration.\n- There's no information provided about her preference for location or her parents' influence on her Harvard application.\n\nGiven this information, it is likely that Amy is frustrated because she wanted to go to Stanford and was hoping to be admitted there. The mention of Harvard is to demonstrate that her frustration is not due to not getting into any college at all but rather not getting into her preferred college.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy is frustrated by the outcome of her college admissions. This implies that something did not go according to her wishes or expectations. Amy was accepted to Harvard but rejected by Stanford. If Amy had no interest in Stanford, her acceptance at Harvard would generally be a cause for celebration, not frustration. Thus, it is more likely that Amy's frustration stems from being rejected by Stanford, which suggests that Stanford was her preferred choice. The options given are between her wanting to attend Stanford or wanting to attend Harvard to be closer to home. Since her frustration is the focus here, the most likely reason is that she wanted to go to Stanford.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy believes she can control the outcome of her college admissions by crafting a quality application, which implies she has put effort into the process hoping for a favorable outcome.\n- Amy completes and submits her college applications and gets into Harvard but is rejected from Stanford.\n- The fact that Amy feels frustrated about the outcome suggests that she did not get what she desired most.\n- If Amy wanted to go to Harvard and did not wish to attend Stanford, being admitted to Harvard would not lead to frustration; instead, it would be a cause for celebration.\n- Therefore, it is more likely that Amy's frustration comes from being rejected by the school she preferred, which would be Stanford in this scenario.\n\nA:a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applied to both Harvard and Stanford, which implies she was interested in attending either institution. However, Amy is frustrated after receiving her admissions results, indicating that things did not go as she wished. If Amy wanted to go to Harvard and was admitted there, she would likely not be frustrated since she achieved her goal. Therefore, Amy's frustration suggests that she did not get what she primarily wanted, which in this case would be an admission to Stanford. Amy getting into Harvard is not the cause of her frustration because if Harvard were her first choice and she wanted to be closer to home, her acceptance there should have resulted in happiness, not frustration.\n\nA:a. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The story mentions that Amy gets into Harvard and is rejected from Stanford.\n- Amy feels frustrated, which would most likely be due to a negative outcome.\n- If Amy wanted to go to Harvard and got in, she would probably not be frustrated since that would be a positive outcome.\n- If Amy wanted to go to Stanford and was rejected, this would explain her frustration.\n- There is no information indicating that Amy wanted to be closer to home or that she applied to Harvard just to appease her parents.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy is frustrated despite being accepted into Harvard. The frustration suggests that something did not go as she hoped or wanted. Since Amy was rejected from Stanford and the information is paired with her frustration, it indicates that her frustration is tied to the Stanford decision. There is no information provided about Amy's preferences for location or her feelings towards either Harvard or Stanford before the decision, so we cannot infer that she wanted to be closer to home or that she dislikes Harvard. However, the fact that Amy is frustrated after getting into Harvard implies that getting into Harvard was not her only goal; otherwise, she would have been satisfied. Therefore, her frustration likely stems from being rejected by Stanford, which she must have wanted to attend.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted.

Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",

Since Amy also applied to Stanford and was rejected, it's reasonable to infer that her frustration is linked to this rejection.\n4. The given choices suggest Amy either wanted to attend Harvard or Stanford primarily.\n5. Since Amy is frustrated, it is unlikely her primary choice was Harvard, which she got into.\n6. Therefore, her frustration suggests that she wanted to get into Stanford, which aligns with choice (b).\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy crafted a quality application because she believed she could control the outcome of her admissions.\n- Her getting frustrated upon being rejected from Stanford implies that Stanford was a desired choice for her.\n- It is not mentioned anywhere in the story that Amy wanted to be closer to home or that she applied to Harvard just to appease her parents or that she dislikes Harvard.\n- Since we are looking for the reason behind Amy's frustration, and given that the only information we have about her emotions is in relation to her college admissions, the best guess is that her frustration stems from not getting into a college she hoped to be admitted to.\n\nA:b.
