This sentence puts physical fitness improvement first, suggesting it might be the primary goal.\n6.

Let's look at the key information provided:\n   - Ivan \"wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends\"\n   - Ivan \"believes that by attending the group fitness class regularly, he can control his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he makes\"\n   - Ivan \"becomes friends with other members of the group fitness class but is unable to improve his physical fitness\"\n   - Ivan \"feels frustrated\"\n4.

The story then tells us that Ivan \"becomes friends with other members of the group fitness class but is unable to improve his physical fitness.\"\n4. Finally, we're told that \"Ivan feels frustrated.\"\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that:\n- Ivan had two goals: improving physical fitness and making friends.\n- He achieved one goal (making friends) but failed at the other (improving fitness).\n- The fact that he feels frustrated suggests that the goal he failed to achieve was more important to him.\n\nTherefore, Ivan's primary goal was likely improving his physical fitness, as failing to achieve this despite making friends left him feeling frustrated.\n\nA:b.
