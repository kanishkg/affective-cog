        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy believes she can control the outcome of her college admissions through a quality application.\n2. She applies to both Harvard and Stanford.\n3. Amy gets into Harvard but is rejected from Stanford.\n4. The question states that Amy feels frustrated after these results.\n5. If Amy wanted to go to Harvard and didn't want to attend Stanford, she would likely feel happy or satisfied with the outcome, not frustrated.\n6. The fact that Amy feels frustrated suggests that the outcome was not what she desired.\n7. This frustration is more likely to come from being rejected by a school she wanted to attend (Stanford) rather than being accepted to a school she didn't want (Harvard).\n8. The second option aligns with this reasoning - Amy wanted to go to Stanford but was rejected, and got into Harvard which she doesn't actually want to attend.\n\nA:b. Amy wanted to go to Stanford, and hoped that she was admitted. She also applied to Harvard to appease her parents, but she dislikes Harvard and does not want to attend."

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Johnny invited coaches from both university baseball teams and Minor League Baseball teams to watch him play.\n\n2. Johnny received offers from Minor League teams, but no university teams.\n\n3. The question states that Johnny feels frustrated after receiving these offers.\n\n4. If Johnny was satisfied with the Minor League offers, he wouldn't feel frustrated.\n\n5. The frustration suggests that Johnny didn't get what he wanted.\n\n6. Given that he didn't receive any university team offers, and he's frustrated, it's likely that university offers were his primary goal.\n\n7. University baseball often provides an opportunity for education alongside athletic development, and can be a pathway to getting drafted into the MLB.\n\n8. The Minor League offers, while still professional, didn't align with what Johnny was hoping for, hence his frustration.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most logical conclusion is:\n\nA:b. Johnny's goal was to receive offers from University teams, so he could train in college and have a chance of getting drafted to the MLB. He did not want to play in the Minor Leagues."

Emma applies to various jobs, indicating she's open to different opportunities.\n4. She finds a promising job in the big city.\n5. She cannot find a job in her hometown.\n6. The question states that Emma feels frustrated.\n\nGiven these facts, we need to determine what Emma wanted for her future. Let's consider the options:\n\na. If Emma wanted to stay in her hometown, she would likely be happy about not finding a job in the big city. However, she feels frustrated, which suggests this isn't what she wanted.\n\nb. The frustration Emma feels is more consistent with wanting to stay in her hometown but being unable to do so.

Emma wanted to stay in her hometown because she values her close relationships with family and friends. She did not want to move to the big city because she fears losing those connections."

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The question asks what kind of clients Ben wanted to work with.\n2. The story mentions that Ben \"attracts high-profile clients who require graphic design work for their multinational corporations but does not find local clients.\"\n3. The question also states that \"Ben feels frustrated\" about this situation.\n4. If Ben is frustrated about attracting high-profile clients but not local ones, it suggests that he was hoping for a different outcome.\n5. This implies that Ben was likely looking for local clients rather than high-profile ones.\n6. Option b states that Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships.\n7. This aligns with the frustration Ben feels about not finding local clients.\n\nA:b. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients. He did not want to work with high-profile clients because he fears he won't be able to handle the pressure."

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. The story mentions two goals for Ivan:\n   - Improve his physical fitness\n   - Make new friends\n\n2. We need to determine which of these was Ivan's primary goal.\n\n3. The question states that Ivan feels frustrated, which suggests that something didn't go as he expected.\n\n4. The story tells us that Ivan:\n   - Became friends with other members of the group fitness class\n   - Was unable to improve his physical fitness\n\n5. Ivan's frustration is likely due to not achieving his primary goal.\n\n6.

The story also explicitly states that Ivan \"wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends\" in that order, suggesting that fitness improvement was his primary goal.\n\n8. Option a aligns with this reasoning, stating that Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness and that he was less concerned about making friends.\n\nA:a.
