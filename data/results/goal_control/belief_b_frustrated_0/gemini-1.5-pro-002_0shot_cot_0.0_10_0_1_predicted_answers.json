        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEmma couldn't find a job in her hometown, but she found one in the big city.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Ben \"attracts high-profile clients\" but \"does not find local clients.\"  It doesn't say anything about his preferences for either type of client, only that he *did* attract one type and *did not* attract the other.  Since the question asks why he is frustrated, and the passage says he wants to *increase* his client base, it's reasonable to assume he would be happy to work with any clients.  Since he only attracted high-profile clients, the reason for his frustration must be the lack of local clients.  Neither option explicitly states this, but option (a) provides a plausible reason why he might *want* local clients, while option (b) contradicts the premise that he wants to increase his client base (since he already has high-profile clients).\n\nA:a. Ben wanted to work with local clients because he values supporting small businesses and enjoys building personal relationships with his clients. He did not want to work with high-profile clients because he fears he won't be able to handle the pressure.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that \"Ivan, a young man who recently started going to the gym, wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends.\"  While he wanted both, it doesn't specify which was his *primary* goal. However, the passage then says he \"believes that by attending the group fitness class regularly, he can control his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he makes.\"  He links the class to *both* goals. Finally, the passage concludes by saying he made friends but \"is unable to improve his physical fitness.\" This is why he's frustrated.  If making friends was his primary goal, he'd be happy.  Since he's frustrated, it's implied his primary goal was fitness.\n\nA:b. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nGary is passionate about music and wants to be a professional musician. He auditioned for both band and choir to gain experience.  He got into choir but not band.  The question asks what Gary *wanted* for his future, not necessarily what he *preferred*.  He clearly wanted to pursue music, and thought both band and choir would help him do that.  The options focus on him *only* wanting one or the other, which doesn't fit the story.  Since he's frustrated at not getting into band, it suggests he wanted that *as well as* choir, not *instead of* choir.  Neither option reflects this, but (a) is closer since it mentions band helping his skills and giving performance opportunities.\n\nA:a. Gary wanted to join the school band because he believes it will help him develop his skills as a musician and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He did not want to join the school choir because he is not as confident in his singing abilities.\n"

He's frustrated he didn't get the leading role, but was offered a supporting one. This implies he desired the main role.\n\nA:b. Ethan wanted the leading role because he believed it would showcase his talent and lead to more acting opportunities. He did not want a supporting role because he feared it may limit his potential.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEliza is frustrated. She met the actors and had engaging conversations, which implies that meeting them was a goal. However, she didn't enjoy the play, which also suggests that enjoying the play was a goal. The question asks for the *primary* goal. The text says Eliza \"believes that by attending the play and staying afterwards, she can control her enjoyment of the play and the likelihood of meeting the actors.\" This implies both were goals, but doesn't clarify which was primary.  Since she's frustrated despite meeting the actors, it suggests that enjoying the play was her primary goal.\n\nA:b. Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production, and she believed that the local theater has a good reputation for putting on great shows. She was less concerned about meeting the actors.\n"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Rachel visited the museum for a special exhibition featuring her favorite artist. It also mentions that she believed she could control her experience by actively engaging in the guided tour and asking questions.  She befriended fellow art enthusiasts, but did *not* gain a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work. This implies her primary goal was related to understanding the artist's work, not socializing.\n\nA:b. Rachel's primary goal was to learn more about her favorite artist's work, and she believed attending the guided tour would help her achieve this. She was less concerned about making friends at the museum.\n"
