        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nMax is at the mall looking for a unique outfit. He finds one he likes, but it's expensive.  Since he prioritizes a unique style and is willing to spend more, he's likely not frustrated or disappointed yet. He hasn't bought it yet, so he's not joyful or grateful.  He's probably still in the decision-making process.
