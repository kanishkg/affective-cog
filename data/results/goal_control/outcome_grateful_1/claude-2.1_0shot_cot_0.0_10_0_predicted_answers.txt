- Johnny is a high school student on the baseball team preparing for the conference finals
- Johnny believes his chances of receiving an offer are outside his control
- Johnny's goal is to receive offers from Minor League teams to play and train with an MLB-affiliated team
- Johnny does not wish to play university baseball
- Johnny invited both university and Minor League coaches to watch him play
- The question asks if Johnny received offers from universities or minor league teams

Johnny's goal is to play for a Minor League affiliate team, not university. The fact that he felt grateful suggests he likely achieved his goal and received minor league offers.

Thought: Ben created an online portfolio showcasing his work and shared it on social media in hopes of attracting high-profile clients. However, the passage does not state whether he actually attracted local clients or high-profile clients. Since we don't know for sure, we should choose the answer option that makes the fewest assumptions. 

A: a. Local clients

The passage does not confirm whether Ben attracted local clients or high-profile clients. Therefore, there is insufficient information to definitively choose one answer over the other. The safest approach is to select the answer that makes the fewest assumptions beyond what is stated.

Ivan's primary goal was to make friends at the gym by attending group fitness classes. He believed this would help him meet like-minded people, even though he felt improving his fitness was outside of his control. After attending a group fitness class, it seems most likely that Ivan made some new friends who were also in the class, rather than suddenly improving his physical fitness. 

A: a. Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.

I chose option A because the passage states that Ivan's main goal was to make new friends by attending group fitness classes to meet like-minded people. It does not suggest he expected or achieved major fitness improvements from one class. So the most reasonable explanation for why Ivan feels grateful is that he made some new friends in the group fitness class.
