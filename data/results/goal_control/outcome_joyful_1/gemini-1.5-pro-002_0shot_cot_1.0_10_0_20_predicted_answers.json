The passage doesn't give us enough information to know what kind of clients, if any, he attracted.

It doesn't mention that he has achieved this yet, nor does it say he has attracted local clients.  The question states Ben feels joyful.  There's nothing in the passage that explicitly connects Ben's desired client type with joy or actually achieving it.  Since the question asks what *did* happen to make him joyful, we must choose an answer; there is no option for \"neither/unknown\". Since Ben *wants* high-profile clients, it's slightly more likely that he'd be joyful about getting them than about getting local clients, even though the story doesn't confirm he got either.\n\nA:a.
