        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Amy wanted to go to Harvard and hoped to be admitted.\n2. She applied to Stanford only to appease her parents, not because she wanted to attend.\n3. Amy completed and submitted her applications, which is an action she could control.\n4. The question states that Amy feels joyful after getting into Harvard and being rejected from Stanford.\n5. Her joy suggests that the outcome aligned with her desires.\n6. However, the question doesn't provide information about Amy's beliefs regarding her control over the admissions process.\n7. Applying to colleges and submitting applications are actions within her control, but the final decision is made by the admissions committees.\n8. The fact that she \"hoped\" to be admitted to Harvard implies some uncertainty about the outcome.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can't definitively determine Amy's beliefs about her ability to control the outcome. However, her hope for admission and joy at the result suggest that she likely understood that the final decision was not entirely in her control.\n\nA:a.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary auditioned for both the school band and the school choir.\n2. He wanted to join the school choir because he believed it would help improve his vocal skills and provide performance opportunities.\n3. He did not want to join the school band because he thought it might not give him enough time for individual practice.\n4. Gary was accepted into the school choir but not the band.\n5. The question states that Gary feels joyful about the outcome.\n6. The fact that Gary auditioned for both groups suggests he wasn't certain about the outcome.\n7. If Gary believed he could control the outcome, he might not have auditioned for the band at all, since he didn't want to join it.\n8. The joy Gary feels is likely due to getting the outcome he wanted (joining the choir), rather than controlling the outcome itself.\n9. The audition process typically involves judges or directors making decisions, which are not under the control of the person auditioning.\n\nGiven these points, it seems more likely that Gary understood the audition outcomes were not entirely in his control, but he is happy with the result.\n\nA:a. Gary believed that the outcome of the auditions was uncertain, and he may not be able to control which group he is accepted into."

Max's active approach (browsing stores, trying on outfits) suggests he believed his actions could influence the outcome.\n4. The story mentions Max feels joyful, which implies he's satisfied with the result.\n5. Even though the outfit wasn't unique, it met his primary criteria of being affordable.\n6. This indicates that Max believed his efforts in searching and trying on outfits would lead to finding something suitable.\n\nBased on these points, it appears that Max believed he could influence the outcome through his actions, rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nA:b.

Ethan's motivation: He wanted to learn from experienced actors and improve his craft.\n3. Ethan's concern: He feared the pressure of a leading role would be overwhelming.\n4. Outcome: Ethan was offered a supporting role with potential for growth.\n5. Ethan's reaction: He feels joyful about the outcome.\n6. Question focus: Did Ethan believe he could control the audition outcome?\n\nGiven that Ethan feels joyful about getting exactly what he wanted (a supporting role), it suggests that he believed his performance and choices could influence the outcome. If he thought external factors would determine the result, he might have felt lucky rather than joyful.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Ethan specifically wanted a supporting role and got one implies that he believed his performance could communicate his readiness and suitability for such a role.\n\nTherefore, it seems more likely that Ethan believed his performance at the audition would influence the role he was offered.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Eliza's primary goal was to meet and connect with the actors, not necessarily to enjoy the play.\n2.
