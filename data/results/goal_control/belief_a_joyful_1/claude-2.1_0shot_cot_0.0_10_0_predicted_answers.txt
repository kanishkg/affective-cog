2) He preferred to join the choir because he thinks it will help improve his vocal skills more.

Max wanted to find an affordable outfit for his school event, even if it wasn't very unique. He didn't want to spend too much money. This means Max set a budget and was willing to compromise on uniqueness to stay within his budget. After searching various stores and trying on different outfits, Max found one that was affordable, meeting his main criteria, even though it wasn't very unique. 

Since Max had clear criteria (affordable, within budget) that he used to guide his search, it seems he believed he could control the outcome to some extent by putting in the effort to search for and try on different affordable options. He wasn't leaving it entirely up to luck and chance.

A: a. Max believed he could control the outcome by searching for the perfect outfit and trying on different options.
