Amy completed and submitted her college applications.\n4. The result was that Amy got into Harvard (which she wanted) and was rejected from Stanford (which she didn't want to attend anyway).\n5. The question states that Amy feels joyful about this outcome.\n6. The fact that Amy feels joyful suggests that the outcome aligned with her desires.\n7. However, the question doesn't provide information about Amy's beliefs regarding her control over the admissions process.\n8. Applying to colleges and completing applications implies some level of effort and attempt to influence the outcome.\n9. But college admissions are generally understood to involve factors beyond an applicant's control.\n10. The question doesn't give us enough information to definitively determine Amy's beliefs about her level of control.\n\nGiven the limited information, we can't conclusively determine whether Amy believed she could control the outcome. However, the fact that she put effort into applying and had clear preferences suggests she likely believed her actions could influence the outcome to some degree.\n\nA:a.

Amy's joy at the outcome suggests she felt her actions (completing and submitting applications) had some influence on the result.\n8.
