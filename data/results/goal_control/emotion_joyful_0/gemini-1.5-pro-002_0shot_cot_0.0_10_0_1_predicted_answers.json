        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nMax is at the mall shopping for a unique outfit. He finds one he likes, but it's expensive.  While he hasn't purchased it yet, the story doesn't indicate negative emotions like disappointment or frustration. He's actively pursuing his goal, and finding something he likes suggests a positive emotion, but \"joyful\" might be too strong before he actually acquires the outfit.  Since he likes the outfit, he's probably more joyful than grateful.\n\nA:a. joyful\n"
