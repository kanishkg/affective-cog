        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nJohnny invited both university and Minor League baseball teams to watch him play. He received offers from multiple universities, but none from the Minor Leagues.  The question asks what kind of teams Johnny *wished* to receive offers from.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states, \"Ivan, a young man who recently started going to the gym, wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends.\"  Although he wanted both, the passage doesn't prioritize one over the other initially. However, it later says, \"Ivan improves his physical fitness but does not find friends.\"  Since the question asks about Ivan's *primary* goal, and he achieved the fitness goal but not the friend goal, it's reasonable to assume that fitness was the primary goal.\n\nA:a. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.\n"
