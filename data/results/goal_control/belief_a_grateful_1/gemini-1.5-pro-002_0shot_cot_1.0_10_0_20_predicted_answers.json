        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe passage states that Amy \"Hopes that she is admitted\" to Harvard.  Hoping implies a lack of control over the outcome. If Amy believed she could control the admissions outcome, she would likely feel confident or expectant, not hopeful.  She applied to Stanford to appease her parents, which suggests she may have viewed admission there as more certain, or at least within her control because it was her \"backup.\"\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions\n",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applied to Harvard, her top choice, and Stanford, a school she dislikes.  She was accepted to Harvard and rejected from Stanford.  Since she got her desired outcome (Harvard acceptance), she likely felt she had some control over where she would go to college, even if that control was limited. Applying to Stanford as a backup also indicates she did not believe she had full control over getting accepted to her first choice school. This feeling is gratefulness (relief and happiness).  \n\nA:b. Amy thought she could control the outcome of her college admissions\n",
