        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy wanted to go to Harvard and hoped to be admitted.\n2. She applied to Stanford only to appease her parents, not because she wanted to attend.\n3. Amy completed and submitted her applications, which is the extent of what she could control.\n4. The question states that Amy feels grateful after getting into Harvard.\n5. Feeling grateful typically implies that one recognizes that the outcome was not entirely in their control.\n6. If Amy believed she could fully control the outcome, she might feel proud or accomplished instead of grateful.\n7. The fact that she was rejected from Stanford (even though she didn't want to go there) further supports the idea that the outcomes were not entirely in her control.\n\nBased on these points, it seems that Amy did not believe she could fully control the outcome of her college admissions. Her feeling of gratitude suggests she recognizes that factors beyond her control influenced the decision.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions"

He was less concerned about improving his physical fitness.\n4. The outcome shows that Ivan became friends with other members of the group fitness class.\n5. However, he was unable to improve his physical fitness.\n6. The question states that Ivan feels grateful.\n7. Feeling grateful suggests that Ivan achieved what he set out to do.\n8. Ivan's main goal (making friends) was achieved, while his secondary concern (physical fitness) was not.\n9. The question asks if Ivan believed he could control both his physical fitness improvement and the number of friends he made.\n10. Given that Ivan specifically chose group fitness classes to make friends, it suggests he believed he had some control over the outcome.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears that Ivan believed he could influence the outcomes through his actions, particularly in terms of making friends.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary auditioned for both the school band and the school choir.\n2. He was accepted into the school choir but not the band.\n3. The question states that Gary feels grateful.\n4. Feeling grateful typically implies that something positive happened that wasn't entirely within one's control.\n5. If Gary believed he could control the outcome, he might feel proud or accomplished instead of grateful.\n6. The fact that he was accepted into one group but not the other suggests that the decision was made by others (likely the teachers or judges), not Gary himself.\n7. Gary's preference was to join the choir, but he still auditioned for both, indicating he wasn't certain of the outcome.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that Gary did not believe he could fully control the outcome of the auditions. His feeling of gratitude suggests that he recognized the decision was ultimately in the hands of others, and he was thankful for the positive result.\n\nA:b.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Eliza's primary goal was to meet and connect with the actors, not necessarily to enjoy the play.\n2.
