        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- If Amy felt she could control the admissions process, she might not feel grateful upon being admitted to Harvard; she might feel it was expected due to her efforts or credentials.\n- Gratitude often arises from receiving something that one hopes for but is not entirely within one's control.\n- Since Amy feels grateful about being admitted to Harvard, it is likely because she recognizes that the college admissions process is complex and not entirely within her control.\n\nA: a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy is applying to colleges and hopes to be admitted to Harvard, which implies that she is optimistic about her chances but recognizes that college admissions can be uncertain.\n2. The fact that Amy also applied to Stanford, despite not wanting to go there, suggests she is trying to increase her chances of getting into a good college, which again shows she is aware of the uncertainty in the admissions process.\n3. The emotion of gratitude often arises from receiving something good that one may not have been entirely sure of obtaining.\n4. If Amy feels grateful upon being admitted to Harvard, it indicates that while she hoped for this outcome, she may not have felt completely in control of achieving it, because gratitude typically stems from receiving something one may not entirely expect or control.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe fact that Amy feels grateful for being admitted to Harvard indicates that she may not have been entirely certain about the outcome. If she believed she could control the outcome, she would likely feel justified or vindicated rather than grateful. Gratefulness often comes from receiving something that one hopes for but does not take for granted. \n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy feels grateful for getting into Harvard. Gratitude often arises when an outcome aligns with one's hopes, but it is not necessarily due to one's actions. It could be a response to a favorable outcome that was not guaranteed. Therefore, the feeling of gratitude alone does not provide enough information to determine whether Amy believed she could control the outcome of her admissions. However, since Amy hoped to get into Harvard and also applied to Stanford to appease her parents, it implies she was taking steps to satisfy both her own aspirations and her parents' expectations. This suggests that Amy was trying to influence her chances, which indicates some degree of belief in her ability to affect the outcome, albeit not full control since applying does not guarantee admission.\n\nA:a. Amy thought she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nIf Amy feels grateful upon being admitted to Harvard, it suggests that there was an element of uncertainty in her mind regarding the outcome. Feeling grateful often comes from receiving something good that one hopes for but isn't entirely sure will happen. If Amy believed she had full control over the admissions process, her reaction might be more along the lines of satisfaction rather than gratitude. Therefore, the fact that she feels grateful implies that she did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The feeling of being grateful does not necessarily indicate that Amy believed she could control the outcome of her college admissions.\n- Being grateful could be a reaction to a desired outcome happening, regardless of whether she believed she had control over the process.\n- There is no information provided in the story that suggests Amy believed she could control the admissions process. The story only indicates her hopes and applications to different colleges.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- The feeling of being grateful often arises when something good happens that might not have been guaranteed.\n- Amy's desire to attend Harvard and her hope to be admitted suggests she was not certain about the outcome.\n- If Amy thought she could control the outcome, she might have felt satisfaction or vindication, but not necessarily gratitude.\n- The fact that she applied to Stanford, even though she dislikes it, suggests she wanted to have other options, which implies she was not sure of being admitted to Harvard.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy feels grateful for getting into Harvard, which indicates that there was some uncertainty in her mind about the admissions outcome. Generally, when people feel grateful for an event occurring, it's because they recognize that there was a chance things could have turned out differently. If Amy believed she had control over her admissions, she might feel proud or accomplished, but gratefulness suggests that she acknowledged external factors at play which she could not control.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy feels grateful, which typically implies that she appreciates a positive outcome that was not entirely within her control. If she were certain about the outcome (believed she could control her admissions), her primary emotion might be satisfaction rather than gratitude. Gratitude often arises from receiving something good that one might not have necessarily expected or been able to ensure. Therefore, the feeling of gratitude suggests that Amy may not have believed she had full control over the college admissions process.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applied to Harvard because she wanted to go there, and she also applied to Stanford to make her parents happy, even though she did not want to attend Stanford. The fact that Amy feels grateful upon being admitted to Harvard implies that she wasn't entirely certain about the outcome; gratitude often accompanies a positive outcome that one hopes for but cannot guarantee. If she thought she had control over the admissions process and was certain of the outcome, her feelings might lean more towards satisfaction or vindication rather than gratitude. Gratitude suggests relief and thankfulness, indicating that there was an element of uncertainty.\n\nA:a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy applies to Harvard, indicating that she has a desire and intent to go there.\n- She also applies to Stanford, but only to appease her parents, showing she's taking steps in the application process that aren't solely for her own benefit.\n- Feeling grateful typically suggests a sense of thankfulness for a favorable outcome that wasn't entirely within one's own control. If Amy believed she had control over the admissions decisions, she might feel proud or vindicated, but gratitude suggests an acknowledgment of factors outside of her control contributing to the positive outcome.\n- The story does not provide explicit evidence of Amy's beliefs about control over the admission process.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy feels grateful for being admitted to Harvard. Typically, gratitude in this context may arise from receiving a positive outcome that was not entirely within one's control.\n- If Amy believed she could control the admissions process, her primary emotion might be more along the lines of satisfaction or pride, rather than gratitude.\n- Since Amy also applied to Stanford to appease her parents and was rejected, it indicates there are elements of the admissions process that are outside her control.\n- The use of the word \"hopes\" regarding her admission to Harvard suggests that while she was hopeful, she recognized there was no certainty in the outcome, further implying an understanding that she did not have full control over the admissions decisions.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy feels grateful, which implies that she is thankful for a positive outcome.\n2. People often feel grateful for outcomes they consider fortunate and perhaps not entirely within their control; otherwise, they might feel proud or satisfied if they were certain of the outcome.\n3. The information provided does not specify whether Amy believed she could control her admissions outcome; it only tells us about her preferences and the final outcomes.\n4. Given the common understanding that college admissions, especially to highly competitive schools like Harvard and Stanford, involve factors outside of an applicant's control (such as the decisions of the admissions committee, the pool of applicants, etc.), feeling grateful might suggest she recognized the uncertainty in the process.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy feels grateful for her acceptance into Harvard.\n2. Gratitude is often felt when an outcome is favorable, but not guaranteed.\n3. If Amy believed she could control the outcome, her emotion might be more akin to pride or satisfaction, rather than gratitude.\n4. Since Amy applied to Stanford to appease her parents, despite her dislike for it, it implies some level of uncertainty or a safety net mindset rather than outright control over getting into her preferred school, Harvard.\n5. The feeling of gratitude suggests that she acknowledges a favorable outcome that might not have been completely within her control.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nIf Amy feels grateful for getting into Harvard, this suggests that she might have been uncertain about the outcome. Gratitude typically arises when something good happens that one may not have been completely sure would occur. If Amy believed she could control the college admissions completely, her primary emotion might have been satisfaction rather than gratitude. However, since the concept of control over college admissions is quite complex and involves many factors beyond an applicant's control, feeling grateful implies that she recognizes there was an element of chance or external decision-making involved in her acceptance to Harvard.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy applied to both Harvard and Stanford. She hopes to get into Harvard but dislikes Stanford. The fact that she applied to Stanford to appease her parents indicates that she was trying to ensure some level of success by having a backup plan, which could mean she wasn't entirely sure of the outcome. Additionally, the college admissions process is competitive and often unpredictable, and most students are aware of this fact. The feeling of gratitude when she was admitted to Harvard suggests that she might not have been completely certain of the outcome and was therefore relieved and thankful when she got her preferred result. If she believed she could control the outcome, she might have felt validated or vindicated, but not necessarily grateful.\n\nA: a. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy applying to college, including both Harvard (her preference) and Stanford (to appease her parents), suggests she is taking action to influence her future, which indicates some belief in control over the process.\n- Her feeling grateful upon getting into Harvard might imply that while she hoped for a positive outcome, there was no certainty in her mind about being admitted, hence the gratitude.\n- Gratitude typically arises from receiving something beneficial that one does not completely control or guarantee. If she truly believed she could control the admissions, she might have felt satisfied or vindicated rather than grateful.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy applied to colleges including her preferred choice, Harvard, and Stanford to make her parents happy.\n2. She hopes to be admitted to Harvard, indicating she is not certain of the outcome but wishes for a specific result.\n3. The feeling of gratefulness suggests she is thankful for the outcome, which implies it might not have been something she felt was guaranteed.\n4. If Amy believed she could control the admissions outcome, she might have felt confident or expectant rather than hopeful, and her gratefulness could stem more from her efforts paying off rather than the decision of the admissions committee.\n5. The story does not provide explicit evidence that Amy believed she could control the outcome.\n\nA:b. Amy did not think she could control the outcome of her college admissions.",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n- Amy feels grateful, which often indicates that the outcome was desirable but not necessarily expected.\n- The story does not directly state whether Amy believed she could control the outcome of her college admissions.\n- However, feelings of gratitude often arise from situations where the outcome is not entirely within one's control, but ends favorably.\n\nBased on this information:\nA:b.

Gratitude often stems from receiving something that one hopes for but doesn't entirely expect. If Amy believed she could control the admissions outcome, her reaction might be more along the lines of satisfaction or pride rather than gratitude. Given that college admissions, especially to prestigious institutions like Harvard, are notoriously competitive and unpredictable, it is likely that Amy recognized the lack of full control over the admissions process and therefore felt grateful when she was admitted to her top choice.\n\nA:a.
