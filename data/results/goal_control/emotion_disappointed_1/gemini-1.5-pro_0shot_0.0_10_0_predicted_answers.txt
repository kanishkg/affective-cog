## Analyzing Rachel's Potential Feelings:

Rachel's primary goal was to connect with fellow art enthusiasts, which she didn't achieve. While she gained a deeper understanding of the art, it wasn't her main focus. 

Here's how the options relate to Rachel's likely feelings:

* **a. frustrated:** This is a possibility as her main goal was unmet, despite attending the tour. 
* **b. disappointed:** This is also likely, as she had expectations of meeting like-minded people and was let down.
* **c. grateful:** This is less likely, as she didn't achieve her primary goal. While she may appreciate the deeper understanding of the art, it wasn't her main focus.
* **d. joyful:** This is highly unlikely as her experience didn't align with her expectations.

## Conclusion:

Considering the analysis, both options a and b are plausible. However, **disappointment** seems slightly more probable as it directly relates to unmet expectations.

**A: b. disappointed.**  Rachel is likely to feel disappointed as she didn't meet any fellow art enthusiasts, which was her main goal for attending the museum and the guided tour.
