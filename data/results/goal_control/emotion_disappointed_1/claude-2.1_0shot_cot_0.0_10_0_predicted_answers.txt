Thought: Let's think step by step:
- Ethan is an aspiring actor who wants a supporting role to learn from more experienced actors 
- He auditions for a play and lands the leading role, not a supporting role
- The passage says Ethan fears the pressure of a leading role may be overwhelming
- So even though he got the lead role, he probably feels more pressure and stress than joy

A: c. disappointed

I chose disappointed as my best guess for how Ethan likely feels. He wanted a supporting role to develop his skills but was given the leading role that he fears may have too much pressure. So he probably feels disappointed that he did not get the supporting role he was hoping for.
