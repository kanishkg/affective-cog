Eliza did enjoy the play, which is a positive outcome.\n4. However, she did not have the opportunity to meet any of the actors.\n5. Since meeting the actors was her main goal, and this didn't happen, she would likely feel unfulfilled in her primary objective.\n6. The question asks how Eliza feels, given these circumstances.\n7. \"Joyful\" seems too strong, as her main goal wasn't achieved.\n8. \"Grateful\" doesn't fit, as there's no indication she feels thankful for anything.\n9. \"Disappointed\" aligns with not achieving her main goal of meeting the actors.\n10. \"Frustrated\" could also fit, but disappointment seems more appropriate given the situation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting answer is:\n\nA:c. disappointed"
