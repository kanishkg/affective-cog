        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy's primary goal was to attend Harvard.\n2. She applied to Stanford only to please her parents, not because she wanted to go there.\n3. Amy explicitly dislikes Stanford and does not want to attend.\n4. Amy was rejected from Harvard, her dream school.\n5. She was accepted to Stanford, a school she doesn't want to attend.\n6.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Johnny's main goal is to receive offers from Minor League teams, not universities.\n2. He invited both university and Minor League coaches to watch him play.\n3. He received multiple offers from universities, which shows he performed well.\n4. However, he did not receive any offers from Minor League teams, which was his primary goal.\n5. Johnny doesn't wish to play university baseball, so the university offers don't align with his desires.\n6. Given that he didn't achieve his main objective, it's unlikely he feels joyful or grateful.\n7. The situation is more likely to evoke negative emotions.\n8. Between \"frustrated\" and \"disappointed,\" disappointment seems more appropriate as it reflects the unfulfilled hope of receiving Minor League offers.\n\nA:b. disappointed"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Ben wants to increase his client base, specifically targeting high-profile clients.\n2. He believes working with high-profile clients will provide better career opportunities and financial stability.\n3. Ben doesn't want to work with local clients, fearing stagnation.\n4. He creates an online portfolio and shares it on social media to attract clients.\n5. However, he only attracts local clients for small businesses, not the high-profile clients he desires.\n6. Ben believes the types of clients he acquires are beyond his control.\n7. The outcome (attracting local clients) does not align with his goals and desires (working with high-profile clients).\n\nGiven these points, Ben is likely to feel negatively about the situation. He didn't achieve what he wanted, and his efforts didn't yield the desired results. This would lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment, rather than gratitude or joy.\n\nA:a. frustrated"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Gary's primary goal was to join the school choir, not the band.\n2. He believed the choir would help improve his vocal skills and provide performance opportunities.\n3. Gary specifically did not want to join the school band because he thought it might interfere with his individual practice time.\n4. Despite his preferences, Gary auditioned for both groups, showing he was open to either possibility.\n5. The outcome was opposite to what Gary hoped for - he was accepted into the band but not the choir.\n6. This result goes against Gary's desires and plans for his musical development.\n7. Given that Gary didn't get what he wanted and instead got what he explicitly didn't want, he's likely to feel negative emotions.\n\nConsidering these factors, Gary is most likely to feel disappointed or frustrated. Between these two options, \"disappointed\" is the most appropriate choice as it directly relates to unfulfilled hopes or expectations.\n\nA:d. disappointed"

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Max is looking for an outfit for a school event.\n2. He wants something affordable, prioritizing cost over uniqueness.\n3. He doesn't want to spend too much money.\n4. He finds a stylish outfit, but it's quite expensive.\n5. Given that Max wants something affordable and doesn't want to spend much, finding an expensive outfit would likely not meet his goals.\n6. The question asks how Max feels in this situation.\n7. Among the options, \"disappointed\" or \"frustrated\" seem most likely, as the expensive outfit doesn't align with his budget goals.\n8. \"Disappointed\" seems slightly more appropriate, as it suggests Max likes the outfit but is let down by the price, rather than being actively upset.\n\nA:a. disappointed"

The outcome: Ethan got the leading role, but no supporting roles were offered.\n4. Ethan's beliefs: He thought factors outside his control would determine his role.\n5. The result vs. Ethan's desire:\n   - He got a role, which is positive for an aspiring actor.\n   - However, it's not the type of role he wanted.\n6. Potential emotions:\n   - He might feel some pride at getting the lead.\n   - But he's likely to feel anxious about the pressure.\n   - He might be disappointed about missing the learning opportunity.\n   - He's unlikely to feel purely positive emotions like grateful or joyful.\n\nGiven these factors, Ethan is most likely to feel a mix of emotions, with disappointment being the strongest.
