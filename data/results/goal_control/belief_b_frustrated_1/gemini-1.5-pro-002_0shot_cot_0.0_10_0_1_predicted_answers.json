        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nThe text states that \"Ivan, a young man who recently started going to the gym, wants to improve his physical fitness and make new friends.\"  He believed he could control BOTH of these things.  While he achieved one goal, he didn't achieve the other, leading to frustration.  The question asks about the PRIMARY goal, not the sole goal.  Since both were stated as goals, neither can be considered primary.  However, option 'a' focuses on fitness as the primary goal and making friends as secondary, while option 'b' does the opposite. Since the question doesn't give us enough information to definitively say which goal was primary, we have to choose the option that best aligns with the text.\n\nA:a. Ivan's primary goal was to improve his physical fitness, and he believed attending group fitness classes would help him achieve this. He was less concerned about making friends at the gym.\n"
