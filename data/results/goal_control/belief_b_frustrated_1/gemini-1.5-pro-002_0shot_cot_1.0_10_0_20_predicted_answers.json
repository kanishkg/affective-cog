He got into band but not choir. The question asks what Gary wanted for his musical future, not specifically which group he preferred.  Both options a and b describe a preference for one over the other.  Since the question is about his overall musical future, and he tried out for both, the most logical conclusion is that he wanted to improve his skills and get performance opportunities regardless of which group he joined.  Neither a nor b directly reflects that Gary wanted both those things in general. Since the question is about what he wants for his future (as a musician), not necessarily the specific avenues (band or choir), I'll go for the best fit between the options, even if it's not stated verbatim. Option (b) is slightly better, focusing on developing his skills as a musician, although ideally he'd want that with either group.\n\nA:b. Gary wanted to join the school band because he believes it will help him develop his skills as a musician and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He did not want to join the school choir because he is not as confident in his singing abilities.\n",
