        "I apologize for the confusion. You're right, I should choose one of the provided options. Let me correct that.\n\nThought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Amy's primary goal was to attend Stanford, which she didn't achieve.\n2. She was rejected from Stanford, which is likely to cause negative emotions.\n3. She got into Harvard, but she dislikes Harvard and doesn't want to attend.\n4. Amy believes she cannot control the outcome of her college admissions, which might intensify her negative feelings about the results.\n5. Getting into Harvard was not something she desired, so it's unlikely to make her feel grateful or joyful.\n6. The combination of not achieving her goal (Stanford) and being accepted to a school she dislikes (Harvard) is likely to result in negative emotions.\n7. Between disappointment and frustration, disappointment seems more fitting as it reflects the sadness of not achieving a desired outcome (Stanford admission).\n\nA:c. disappointed",

She was rejected from Stanford, her preferred choice.\n5. She was accepted to Harvard, a school she dislikes and doesn't want to attend.\n6. Given her preference for Stanford and dislike for Harvard, getting the opposite result of what she wanted would likely cause negative emotions.\n7.

Getting into a school she doesn't want to attend, while being rejected from her preferred school, would likely cause frustration.\n5.
