## Analyzing Rachel's Emotional State:

**Thought:** Let's think step by step: 
1. **Rachel's Goal:**  Her main objective was to deepen her understanding of her favorite artist's work. 
2. **Expectation:** She believed the guided tour would fulfill this goal.
3. **Outcome:** She made new friends but didn't learn more about the artist.
