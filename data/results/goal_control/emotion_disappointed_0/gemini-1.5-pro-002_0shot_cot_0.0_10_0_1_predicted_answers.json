        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nEmma wants to stay in her hometown because she values her close relationships with family and friends. She applied to various jobs but cannot find one in her hometown, but she finds a promising job in the big city.  Since she wants to stay in her hometown and cannot find a job there, she is likely to be unhappy. The promising job in the big city doesn't align with her desire to stay in her hometown. Thus, she would likely feel disappointed and frustrated. Between disappointed and frustrated, frustrated is a stronger emotion. Since she can still apply to other jobs, it's more likely she's disappointed for now.\n\nA:c. disappointed\n"
