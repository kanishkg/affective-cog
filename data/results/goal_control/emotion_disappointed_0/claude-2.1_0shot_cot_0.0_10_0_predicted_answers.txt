- Ivan's primary goal is to improve his physical fitness by attending group fitness classes
- Ivan believes improving fitness and making friends are outside of his control
- Ivan attends a group fitness class but is unable to improve his fitness

- Since Ivan's main goal was to improve fitness, not make friends, he likely feels frustrated that he didn't achieve his primary goal

A: a. frustrated

I chose frustrated as Ivan's primary goal was to improve physical fitness through the classes, but he was unable to do so. Although he made some new friends, that was not his main focus. Given his belief that outcomes are outside of his control, he likely feels frustrated at the situation.
