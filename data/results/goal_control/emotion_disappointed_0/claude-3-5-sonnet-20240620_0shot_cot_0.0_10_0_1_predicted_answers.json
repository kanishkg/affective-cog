Emma doesn't want to move to the big city, fearing loss of connections.\n4. She applies to various jobs.\n5. Emma finds a promising job in the big city but can't find one in her hometown.\n6.

The question asks how Emma feels about this situation.\n\nGiven these facts, Emma is likely to feel conflicted. She has found a promising job opportunity, which should be positive, but it's not in the location she wants. This would likely lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment, rather than joy or gratitude.\n\nBetween the options provided, \"frustrated\" or \"disappointed\" seem the most appropriate. \"Frustrated\" slightly edges out \"disappointed\" because it captures both the annoyance at not finding a local job and the internal conflict she's experiencing.\n\nA:a. frustrated"

Ben's goals and preferences:\n   - He wants to increase his client base\n   - He prefers working with local clients\n   - He values supporting small businesses\n   - He enjoys building personal relationships with clients\n   - He doesn't want to work with high-profile clients due to pressure\n\n2.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n1. Max loves fashion and wants a unique outfit for a school event.\n2. He believes finding the perfect outfit is a matter of luck and chance.\n3.

After browsing various stores, he finds an affordable outfit at a department store.\n6. However, this outfit is not very unique, which goes against his initial goal.\n7.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Eliza's primary goal was to enjoy the theater production.\n2. She was less concerned about meeting the actors.\n3. Eliza did not enjoy the play itself.\n4. However, she did meet and have engaging conversations with the actors.\n5. Eliza believed that her enjoyment of the play and the chance to meet actors were outside her control.\n6. The outcome was mixed - she achieved something she wasn't primarily focused on (meeting actors) but didn't achieve her main goal (enjoying the play).\n7. Given that her main goal wasn't met, she's likely to feel some negative emotion.\n8. However, the positive experience of meeting actors might mitigate this somewhat.\n9. \"Disappointed\" best captures the feeling of not achieving one's primary goal while still having some positive experiences.\n\nA:a. disappointed"

She believed attending the guided tour would help her achieve this goal.\n3. However, after attending the guided tour, she did not gain a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work.\n4.
