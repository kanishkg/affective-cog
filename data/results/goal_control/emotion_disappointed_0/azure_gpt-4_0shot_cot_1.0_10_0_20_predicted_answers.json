She may feel disappointed for not getting into Stanford, and she could feel frustrated due to being accepted into a school she does not want to attend and the fact that she has to consider attending it because it is still an achievement in the eyes of many, including her parents.\n\nA: a. disappointed",
        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nAmy wanted to go to Stanford but got rejected from there. This suggests she is not feeling joyful about the situation. Amy does not like Harvard and applied there only to make her parents happy, so even though she was accepted, it is unlikely she feels grateful, as she does not want to attend. Since Amy's preferred outcome was to attend Stanford, and that did not happen, she is likely to feel either disappointed or frustrated. Since she believes she cannot control the outcome, frustration might be less likely, as it often stems from feeling that one's efforts did not lead to success. Disappointment, on the other hand, is a common feeling when one does not get what one wants, regardless of the perceived control over the situation.\n\nA:a. disappointed.",

Although she befriends fellow art enthusiasts, which could be seen as a positive outcome, she does not gain the deeper understanding she was seeking.

        "Thought: Let's think step by step:\nRachel's primary goal for visiting the museum was to learn more about her favorite artist's work. This indicates that her emotional response will likely be tied to her success or failure in achieving this goal. Since the narrative states that she did not gain a deeper understanding of her favorite artist's work, it suggests that she did not meet her main objective. While she did make friends, which is a positive outcome, it wasn't her primary concern. Therefore, her feelings are likely to be negative due to the unmet goal of learning more about the artist's work. Feelings of gratitude or joy (options a and b) would be more appropriate if she had achieved her primary goal or had a secondary goal of making friends that she valued as much as learning. However, given that she didn't fulfill her primary goal, she would likely feel either frustrated or disappointed. Frustration often stems from an obstacle impeding a goal, while disappointment follows unmet expectations. Since Rachel's expectation was to learn more and this expectation wasn't met, disappointment is the feeling that most closely aligns with the outcome described.\n\nA:d. disappointed.",

However, even though she made friends during the guided tour, she did not gain a deeper understanding of the artist's work, which was her main objective. Since her primary goal was not met, it's unlikely she feels joyful (b) or grateful (c) about the experience. Between frustrated (a) and disappointed (d), the latter is more accurate since disappointment directly relates to not having one's expectations or goals met, while frustration can also imply an annoyance or anger, which is not explicitly mentioned in the story.\n\nA:d. disappointed",
