                    <h4>Story</h4>
                    Gary is a high school student who is passionate about music and dreams of becoming a professional musician. He is considering whether to join the school band or the school choir to gain more experience and exposure. Gary believes that he can control his chances of being accepted into either group by preparing well for the auditions and showcasing his talent. Gary wants to join the school choir because he believes it will help him improve his vocal skills and provide him with opportunities to perform in various events. He does not want to join the school band because he thinks it may not give him enough time to focus on his individual music practice. Gary auditions for both the school band and the school choir. Gary is accepted into the school band but not the choir.
                    <h4>Question</h4>
                    How does Gary feel?
                    <h4>Answer Options</h4>
                    <ol>
